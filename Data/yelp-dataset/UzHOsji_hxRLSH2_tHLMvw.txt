1	Go elsewhere for service! Quoted one price to sell a piece of jewelry to them, the very next day quoted $75 less for the same piece of jewelry. The do not honor their word!
4	After emailing the corporate office I was soon after contacted by the Manager Randy and he stated that he was sorry about the issue I had selling my jewelry. He received clearance to give me the $75 and honoring the original quote I was initially given. I will return to this pawn shop in the future because they stayed true to their word and did the right thing.
1	I hate this place. They hella low ball you even though what your selling is almost brand new. My laptop toshiba windows 8.1 with antivirus mouse, barely use and Microsoft already downloaded and I was offered $150 for all of that. This place is the worst!
4	Went here on Saturday.  They were not that busy but they were very nice and gave fair pricing and time to go thru lots of old jewelry.
1	This place is a complete rip off. You go to sell them something and they offer you a ridiculously low amount, only to turn around and jack up the price close to the retail NEW price.
