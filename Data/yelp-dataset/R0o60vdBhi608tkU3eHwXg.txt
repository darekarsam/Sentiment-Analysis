3	I would really to give 4 stars and say that I am a fan but I always get a bit frustrated by how much is it difficult to have a selection of raw milk cheese here (and anywhere in Quebec now). Also, they are ripening their own brand of cheese and since then the selection of other cheese seems to have shrink. For instance, it seems that their is no other choices of raw milk camembert  than their own and this is a cheese that benefit so much from the raw milk.So whose to blame? Regulations? The market demand? Hamel pushing their brand? I don't know but I have always that frustration there. Regardless, it's still my favourite place to buy cheese at the Atwater market as they carry the best selection, even if somewhat limited.
