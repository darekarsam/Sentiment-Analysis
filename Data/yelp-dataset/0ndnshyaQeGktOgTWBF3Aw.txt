3	A place that try to be a little too "in" for me... the loud dance music (the place convert to a dance bar after 10 pm) that makes it hard to have a conversation is not really my cup of tea.We came here with a good friend couple that had a "groupon" (so obviously their bill was lower than us) on the night "before the end of world" (Dec. 21, 2012) and they didn't had a reservation for that sold out night... fortunately, the manager gave us a reserve table for four just as we were walking out (and the people that got the table reserved initially never showed up... nice move from his part!).Service was nice. I got a "Bison steak" which was very nice served with sweet potatoes. It's not really a microbrewery kind of place and the wine list was limited (to say the least) so my drink options were limited. The only saving grace was the Guiness.Some people I am sure are just crazy about this type of "hip" places so I do recommend that to those... for the rest of us, it's a fine place but would not be at the top of my list.
1	Bartender ignored us even though it was slow. Then I gave her 10 CDN for a 5 dollar drink. No change.
1	Bartender took ten minutes to ask for my order. I then paid, and she didn't bring me change from the transaction. I thought that was presumptuous for someone who took so long to acknowledge my existence.
