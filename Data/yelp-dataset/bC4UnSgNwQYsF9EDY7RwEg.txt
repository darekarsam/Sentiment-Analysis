2	Really hard for me to write the review as the manager of the store appears to be an honest and kind person.It is apparent that there is no quality control in place at this shop.  Perhaps they need to reconsider, or at a minimum re-educate, their mechanics.
1	This place is HORRIBLE. It is really close to my work so I thought it would be convenient to take it there. First time there all I got is an oil change, no biggie. They told me all my brakes and tires were fine and that they did a tire rotation. Since they rotated my tires I had to bring my car back so my lug nuts could be re torqued. When they were torquing it they broke my lug nut. They had to keep my car over night before they could replace it. Very inconvenient. 1 week later my brakes started squeaking really bad. They told me my brakes were fine so they shouldn't be squeaking. I took it in and they suddenly discovered that my rear brakes weren't fine. In their quote they told me I needed new pads and rotors in the rear($$$) I didn't have the money so I told them I would wait a little. My friend who is a mechanic happened to come in from out of town and offered to take a look at it. He found out several things that were wrong. 1.) I did not need my rotors changed, they were perfectly fine. Monro tried to get me for my money. 2.) My caliper had a screw that was freshly broken off on it (more than likely monros doing) 3.) all I needed was my brake pads changed. 4.) I had a broken lugnut again which monro did not tell me about. This place cannot be trusted. The Manager Bob acts really friendly and pretends to care about you as a customer but it is all a facade. There is no way that he is completely clueless to the low quality of work that is being done. I did not bother going back to them and complaining since they clearly do not care.
