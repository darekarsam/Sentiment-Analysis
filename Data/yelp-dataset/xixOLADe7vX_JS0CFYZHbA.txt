2	Out of the way means local ; hot young crowd . They can't pickle/preserve worth a s....  , but creative occaisionally clumsy mains recompense .good but pressured service , fairly informed. Interesting slightly offbeat wines (look for values) eg 2003 semisweet Loire chenin blanc wowed.Spot on Baguettes,a  good omen,salted butter less so.Greasy odd( oil ) tasting fries, grainy overdone Bavette . Greasy tasty quails ,well cooked tired green beans . SIGH!!
2	I don't like to start a review on a negative tone, but sincerely, stay away from this restaurant if you are willing to eat. Excellent environment to have a drink among friends, and/or have a snack. Very good atmosphere, very cozy and warm in winter. I particularly loved the retro-chique decoration. The food, though, is another story. We ordered different kinds of pasta (group of 8) and all turned out to be so greasy that none could finish his/her dish. We felt stuffed before getting half way through. For such an experience, the food was quite expensive. I paid the bill with regret, and I left the restaurant with a bitter taste in my mouth... Worse than that, when the waiter noticed that we were playing with our food and that we did not like it, started treating us with arrogance and as if we were snubbing him (many of our guests were French from France, and I guess this was a part of the mainland/satellite rivalry).
