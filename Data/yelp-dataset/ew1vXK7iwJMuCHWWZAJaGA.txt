4	Very cozy feeling place! It's not the most amazing looking place but I can assure you it certainly isn't lacking! It's not a very big store but it has an impressive and fun collection! I'm sure you'll find a great read there! I suggest you go check it out!UPTOWN WATERLOO :)
5	Smaller, independent bookstore located in Uptown Waterloo. Friendly and highly knowledgeable staff, good selection of books across a wide range of genres, small but quality selection of magazines and periodicals, sponsored author events, nice relaxed and unhurried atmosphere. Have a great online presence now and in-store will accomodate requests and special-order anything available. Highly recommended indie bookseller.
