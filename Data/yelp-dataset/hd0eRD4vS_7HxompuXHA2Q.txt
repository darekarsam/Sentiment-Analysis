3	This really is a step above some other consignment shops.  The clothes are very high quality, some of which still have the tags on.  There are real finds to be had, but like most consignment places you have to check frequently to see what new things they have.The values can't be beat though.  They have a whole section of items that are $1.  Plus all the other sales and bargains going on.  I'll be checking back with them soon.

However, over the years, I have found some really wonderful deals here on clothing, purses, scarves, etc.   Of course, just like any other consignment shop, you need to allow plenty of time to sift through the racks and take time to try things on.
1	No stars for this place.  I have given loads of clothes for this owner to sell over the years and maybe have been paid for a fraction of them.  My own fault, as I trusted and dropped my clothes without an inventory or receipt.  When I would call to get an accounting of any proceeds due for the sale of my clothes, the owner would say "she had to ask her bookkeeper."   I'm done.
