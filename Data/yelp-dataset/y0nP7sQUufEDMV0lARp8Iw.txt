5	Only Korean influenced menu that I found in Montreal during my short stay here. The food was tasty and authentic in a fusion sort of way.  We liked the meat bun which is like a modified burger.  The food is well prepared and reasonably priced.  If you want to try Korean influenced Asian menu, I'd check them out.
5	Really cute place! It's refreshing to find some good asian food in this part of town. I got the japchae and a pork belly bun. It was all super delicious and the prices are very reasonable. Very friendly staff, the food is prepared fresh by a woman who I assume is the owner. They do take out and I think even delivery, so check it out! There hours are not clear, but they seem to be closed on Sundays.
5	Really nice and great authentic food, cheap and good. The staff speaks korean, it's fast, good and heart warming.
