5	I first saw Dr. Kwok when she had her office in Target and when she started her practice on Union Hills, I didn't hesitate to go.  Dr. Kwok takes her time with you explaining every step of the way.  She detected high eye pressure in both eyes and recommended me  to an ophthalmologist and  now I am being treated with eye drops. Dr. Kwok is always professional, friendly and very personable, I leave there feeling I had the best care and because of Dr. Kwok's demeanor I also leave with a smile.
5	Dr. Kwok and Jeff are the best. If you need your eye exam or want new contacts and glasses, they have the latest and greatest. And ready for this?  Best part. You don't need to worry about that so dreaded air puff that makes your eyes water because you know it's coming. Awesome.
5	One of the best optometrist I have been to so far. Dr. Kwok was very professional and friendly and I got to know more information about the various aspects of the tests more aspects about eyes and eyecare that I haven't heard from other places I visited. I never felt rushed as she took time to explain the methods to keep my eyes stressfree. Also, the front desk employee ( I believe it is Gregg) was super friendly. He assisted me in finding the right frames and also helped in fixing my current one's, which were way too tight for my large head :-). I will be back for sure!!!
5	Dr. Kwok is always willing to give as much time as needed to complete the exam. I never feel rushed and she is actually present and not thinking about her next appointment every time I see her. I really liked my last eye doctor, but Dr. K has more than replaced him. I recommend Ohana to anyone that wants first class attention. Like me, you will be a patient for life.
