4	The oldest farmer's market in NC!  I have no idea how I'm the first to review.  Great little selection of locally grown foods.If King's street market wasn't a couple blocks away I think this place would be known by all.  Kind of a hidden little spot next to the hospital.  Fair prices, great friendly service and, a diverse selection of staples and prepared foods.That pretty much says it.  The history alone means its at least worth a visit.
4	I love this hidden gem which also happens to be the oldest farmer's market in Mecklenburg county.  It is full of locally grown delicious produce!  Heirloom tomatoes, big boys, hot house, purple Cherokees... you name it, they have it.  In addition to the corn, peppers, peaches, berries, eggplants, etc... they also have jams and local baked goods.  Lastly, the Beverly's Gourmet meals to go are divine!  Vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options available.  The tomato pie is fabulous!  These are great meals to drop off when you have signed up to bring a meal to a friend and cannot find the time for homemade... these meals are homemade, just not in your kitchen!They take a debit card.Located next to CMC-Main, park in rear.
5	I absolutely love this little market. It is a year round, all weather type market. It is old, in doors, friendly service and great produce. There are also little knick knacks and home made treats. I especially like the tomato pie and veggie lasagna in the freezer section. The produce is fantastic- you can still find a fresh heirloom tomato in the fall (he has a green house). You feel like you are stepping back in time (except that they do accept debit cards- unlike most markets!)
