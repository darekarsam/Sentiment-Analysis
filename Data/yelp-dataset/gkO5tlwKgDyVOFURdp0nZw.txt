5	Kathie does an amazing job. I was bored with my haircut and unsure what to do. Kathie made some great suggestions to spruce up my look, and I feel so much better about my appearance. I recommend her to every one of my friends.
5	I recently moved back into the Valley and needed someone to do my hair. I chose Kathie because I knew her in High School and because I liked the photos of her work that I had seen on Face Book.I am so glad I decided to go to her!!! I love my hair now ...... she changed my color slightly and it made a huge difference! I will definitely keep having her do my hair!!!
5	Kathy is an amazing stylist. she did my sisters hair from black to red and it turned out gorgeous. I highly recommend her to anyone
5	Thanks Yelpers. My daughter and granddaughter were visiting from California and my granddaughter needed a haircut. Of course, I get my hair cuts at Great Clips so I went to Yelp for help. Kat Hale Hair came up as a nearby recommendation so I sent them off.  They didn't get home for quite awhile - I thought they went to dinner- but when they got home they were both just gushing about their hair cut. Apparently Kate took them as a late appointment; spent a lot of time talking about what my granddaughter wanted and did a totally fabulous job.  They both went back to California but my daughter told me I really should leave this review.  Hair cuts seem so subjective but; apparently, Kate has the talent and ability. I would have to add my recommendation to those that already appear.  Great job Kate.  Keep up the good work!
5	Your professionalism and knowledge makes it a pleasure to service your scissors inorder to perform the quality work you execute with your clients.
5	Thanks Yelp I found Kate Hale, she did my color, cut & blow dry. She does great work.
