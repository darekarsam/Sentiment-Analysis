2	I lived in this apartment complex for the past year. It comes with all of the bells an whistles. This behemoth overshadows the sketchy neighborhood it resides in. Don't get me wrong, I never felt endangered, but you place an expensive jewel in the middle of dirt and it will get dirty.Facility-wise this place is enviable. Huge pool with sandy beach. Large pool/grilling facilities. Volleyball court. Nice, cozy gym. The apartment is ok by my standards. It is basic and ok for the price I suppose. 745 sq. ft. for $800 a month. I was never a fan of my neighbors, and this is where the dirt from the outside starts to seep in. No one was ever friendly towards me. I had loud, obnoxious residents around me. It was, at some points, insufferable. I even had an instance this past spring when the trees and flowers blossomed and grew. They grew right over my stairwell. When I asked if they could send someone to trim it back, they acted like they put it down. It took 3 weeks before anything happened. That is just terrible service. Granted it is not all bad. I wouldn't exactly recommend it, but I am picky. So now you know.
3	This place definitely has it's pluses and minuses.  I lived here for one year and didn't resign another lease because I just wasn't crazy about the other people that lived in the complex and my rent went up too much.The good: -Nice grounds, pool, gym, and the fact that it is a Mark Taylor property (they have great pool and holiday parties)-The apartments are nice and spacious-Big bathroom (at least in my model)The decent:-The neighborhood (convenient for stores and other stuff, but not the safest/nicest looking of areas).  I moved here from Kierland so it's hard to top that.-The leasing office staff is good, not great-Guest parkingThe bad:-The residents (sorry, but most are pretty trashy) and they can often ruin the pool scene-Too many kids at the pool-Too many people sneaking in that don't live there to drink and party-The grills are almost never cleaned.  That sucks.-The volleyball court is always occupied by the same people, so don't expect to play if you aren't one of those regulars.  Lame.I'd really give this place 2.5 stars out of five.
2	I lived her for over two years and there are things that I liked about the place and even more things I disliked about it. Good: -Nice looking place near the front of the complex-The apartment layout 2bd was nice and was good size over 1200 sqft -Maintenance response is pretty goodBad: -The complex really only keep the front of the building clean near the pool area. This is done because all potential renters are only shown the front of the complex. The back of the building by the dog park has dog feces all over the place which smells in the summer and the grill always seem to be broken and are not kept clean. -The average water bill that I paid at the complex averaged 100.00 per month with our highest being over 130.00. When I asked management on several occasions about the cost of water (My average water bill in my home was 80.00 and that was with an above ground pool) I was told it was likely a leak. The complex sent maintenance over and they stated it was a toilet leak on two different occasions. Which I never bought but what could I do. My point of this is that you are really paying for the pool and for the landscaping which is a lot of grass that is watered continuously. -I had read reviews that when you leave the complex that they will nickel and dime you for everything and you will always leave owing money. To counter this I had maintenance fix anything that I deemed could be an extra cost when I moved. About a month after I left, I was called by Mark Taylor and told I owed them over 300.00. I said that when I left I paid all of the rent that I owed plus the water bill and they  said that I owed 6 days of extra rent (I told complex I was moving out on the 20th and my lease went until the 26 and when entered into the system I paid the website through te 20th. I was not aware of this at the time I paid the bill) and I was being charged an extra 150.00 for carpet cleaning. I advised the person at Mark Taylor that in the two years I lived there that I never had the carpet cleaned and that I believed was normal wear and tear. They sent me pictures of the carpet (before it was steam cleaned) and stated that there was dog stains throughout the apartment. Which I know to be a lie as my dog is potty trained and never had an accident. My wife is also a stay at home mom and walked him frequently. I finally did pay the rent as that was my contractual obligation but I refused to pay for the carpet cleaning. -Lastly, the neighborhood itself is not very nice. There are a lot of homeless people in the area and it was starting to feel unsafe at night.
1	Its just another "Bate and Switch" type of business.  I am a new tenant - 2 weeks - when I came in to see the apartments they were wonderful - I saw a couple of units... they looked great - but I wasn't able to see the inside of the unit I wanted to rent...  I was promised that it would get new carpet.... I was excited about this... On my moving day (a hot August day in Arizona - so pure hell) I have my "walk through"...  no new carpet - the kitchen sink is all banged up... two large dents... the bathroom faucet is missing most of the chrome....  the front door is banged up and the frame is chipped in many places...  the floors and counters have a gooey type substance with smear marks and and the toilet still has thick dark urine around the bottom....BUT I signed the document...  I just wanted to get the move over with - as I was paying the movers hourly....  I took care of the cleaning issues and alerted the staff about the kitchen sink, faucet and front door.   I come home to a notice from maintenance that he had  pounded out the dents in the sink as best he could....  really??!?!?!The bathroom faucet is functional so it will not be replaced --  I'm embarrassed to let anyone use it....The front door - no response at all....Once they have you locked in - you are screwed....They will not take care of these issues - fine - just remove "luxury" from the sign out front...
5	So far so good!No apartment complex is perfect, but I am very happy with one. Stephanie did an awesome job showing us the property and the apartment. Knowing that the customer service is this good really made me more secure in leasing here. Also the layout of the apartments was a huge thing for me and Stephanie made sure that I got exactly what I wanted and worked with me for close to two months before we finally locked in a lease. Upon move-in (I moved in the first week of August), the leasing professionals greeted us and showed us to our room to make sure everything checked out and our keys worked. Turned out we had the wrong keys- no big deal. She went right back and got them made right. The apartment itself was in great shape. Very clean, no carpet stains, walls were all freshly painted (though it did seemed rushed a bit). Later in the day I noticed there were carpet ants alongside the kitchen (yuck). I called the office up and they immediately scheduled a pest control to come in and take care of the problem. Since then I haven't seen a single ant. Next thing that went was the indoor rack of the refrigerator that broke right off. Called again and they came in and replaced the entire door versus just jimmy rigging it the next day. A+ for maintenance.  The amenities are gorgeous. The pool is a amazing and the gym is equipped with most of the essentials. Being 24/7 makes it that much better. Everyday I see landscapers working on the property. We recently had a bad storm where many trees fell all over the place and the groundskeepers were there the very next day cleaning it up. A+ for grounds. Thanks again San Pedregal!

1	The management make it very difficult to live here. The amenities a great, but don't let that suck you in. I haven't met too many other residents that are happy living here. Instead, if you like this area, I would recommend The Boulevard Apartments.
