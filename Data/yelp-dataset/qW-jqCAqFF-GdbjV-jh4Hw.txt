4	Good service and nice people working here. Place is super clean as well which is a biggie to me. Prices are fair when you add in shipping costs to buy online supplements.
5	I come here a lot to get my craving for smoothies satisfied.  I love the post work-out smoothie, and the meal replacement smoothies.When I'm super busy and don't have time for a meal, the meal replacement smoothie hits the spot, especially when I have them add in oats.The prices for the smoothies are reasonable especially compared to other places, and their loyalty card has provided me several free smoothies.The smoothies taste great - not too sweet. The texture is perfect, and very satisfying.  This is my favorite smoothie place, and I love smoothies!
5	Love this place! Jeff and Dave along with their staff seem to always make every experience a good one! They are very knowledgeable when it comes to their products and I always see results after following their advice! The smoothies are great but I suggest for those who lift to try their ISOPure products in the fridge, mmmm darn good.
5	The owners and staff are very educated In supplements. Their shakes for pre or post workout are a must! Try the butterfinger mass gainer or the pina colada slimmer. Two of my favorites.
5	The owners Dave and Jeff are what make this place so awesome! Best customer service you will ever find. Great smoothies and excellent quality product that is affordable. Been a long time customer since they opened in 2006.
5	Everytime I come in the place is clean and the employees are pleasant and knowledgable.  My drinks taste great with ever combination I can think of.
