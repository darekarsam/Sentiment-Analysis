4	I joined over one year ago and I love this place! The facility is state of the art and it's more than a gym.  There's day care, after-school programs, group exercise classes, personal training, a nice size pool, etc. It's wonderful to have a place like this in the Hill District.  The staff is great, very friendly.  No matter your income, they help make membership affordable. The membership is diverse. Zumba with Gail is a blast!
5	I have been a member of this Y for about 6 months. It has been a wonderful experience. I have been a member of many gyms but the Y if the first one where the sense of community is obvious and infectious. I started taking spin classes here (they are very popular here for good reason!) the instructors and staff really know how to make you feel at home. All the facilities are clean and the price is right. If you are looking for a motivating environment to get into shape this year this is the place!
4	I moved to Pittsburgh last year and joined this YMCA. I belonged to a much smaller YMCA where I used to live that had about a gazillion more members than this one. It was always crowded. Typically, someone had to get out of the pool before the lifeguard would let you get in. It was that crowded. The pool here is HUGE. During open/lap swim hours, there are usually no more than zero to five other people in the pool. I have never had to wait for a treadmill, but I haven't tried after work, only at lunch time. However, I do use the pool after work and it's not particularly crowded anywhere in the facility at that time. It is busier than at lunch time, but by no means crowded. The place is clean, brand new, and people have been very welcoming and friendly. As a newcomer to Pittsburgh I hoped to meet new people by joining, but because it is fairly empty most of the time I go, I often don't find anyone to meet! That said, the people I have met at this YMCA have been very nice. I think the Thelma Lovette YMCA is one of Pittsburgh's hidden gems.
