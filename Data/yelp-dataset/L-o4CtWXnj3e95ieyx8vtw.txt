2	Dr Shepard was "fair" kind of rude and condeseding and front desk staff is SLOW and rude. Took 45 minutes just to check in and there were only 4 other people waiting. Not a great situation when you have a toddler, if you're an adult bring a book or your laptop. Next time we'll skip and just go to pediatric ER. The staff were all a little put off by people who were sick, especially children and did not take into consideration my child might be scared so they commented on her cryIng with snotty little comments. I overheard the desk staff talking about other patients, so unprofessional. Not a great experience and will never go back unless it's a emergency then I will go to the ER instead. My overall experience with Presbyterian emergency and same day op staff has been less than desirable and I work for Presby!
2	Sometimes people get sick. Sometimes they get sick when they're away from their home and their usual doctor. When that happens, Urgent Care facilities fill the need. Presbyterian was there at 6:00 on a Saturday when others were closed. I brought my mom here with an earache.Helped by a check-in clerk, we got to sit for a long while in a waiting room with an overly loud TV and several people simply glued to the TV. I suppose I can't really point fingers since I was glued to my phone and their free wi-fi.I can't give you a specific review of the doctor or the care once we were called, since I waited while my mom went back. It was about another 45 minutes before she was released (discharged?).On the weekends, parking is a piece of cake. The parking deck is almost completely empty. During the week, you may end up on one of the higher levels.
5	Very fast & friendly! Best experience at an urgent care facility. The doc was very accommodating & professional.
