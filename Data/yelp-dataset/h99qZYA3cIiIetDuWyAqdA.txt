5	Unlike the idiot who wrote the first review. I've actually been to Livewire.  Went for the opening night AZ Foothills party.AMAZING!!!  Simply a game changer in Scottsdale.  Lighting and sound like nothing you've ever seen with  a warm vintage welcoming decor.
3	We had a pretty good time tonight at LiveWire. We got tickets to see Jared and the Mill, one of our favorite local bands, and thought it would be great to go check out the newest concert venue in town. The pros:The venue itself is pretty beautiful. Big bar, multiple couch seating areas, lots of high tops and big bathrooms (with attendants). The giant eagle over the stage was really cool. We didn't get to check out upstairs but it looked like they had booths and VIP seating up there. The sound and lighting systems were top of the line - it sounded great and the lights integrated well into the show. They definitely know what they're doing on that front, the band looked and sounded great. The cons:We were sitting on a couch and an air conditioning vent leaked right onto it (and my husband). I paid four bucks for a diet coke. I guess it's to be expected in Scottsdale but dang. They had two comedians and a solo act as openers - the comedians had a really, really tough time getting any engagement from the crowd, most people continued to talk over them and it was almost painful to watch.Overall, I think it's more of a night club - concert venue than a concert venue - night club. Tonight, it was an interesting mix of the typical Scottsdale club goers and Jared and the Mill fans (and if it was a Venn diagram, the two don't have a big intersection). I do think it's a good venue for rock bands or EDM, but it wasn't quite my slice of pie. I'm sure others really enjoyed it though.
5	Went there for NYE. Great club with plenty of space for dancing, mingling, and lounging. I liked the stage and lighting. Music was very good. I would definitely go there again.
