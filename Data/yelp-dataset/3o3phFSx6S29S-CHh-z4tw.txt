5	chile cheese fries deluxe are recomeneded!
2	I am not impressed with their food, Taco Bell is far better.
3	Better than Taco Bell, just not as cheap!!!
4	My experience here two days ago is most definitely biased because I arrived here after cycling for almost 5 hours in 30mph headwind.  My husband and I decided to do a little bike tour (101 miles on Saturday and 80 miles on Sunday) and it turned out that Sunday was super windy, making what should have been a mellow, easy ride into some sort of sick cycling joke.  Anyway, I think I almost cried tears of joy when we pulled into this Del Taco.  The lady behind the counter was really nice and very interested in our trip, our burritos/fries/veggie bowl/cookies/Cokes (we were really hungry!) were all hot and salted well enough to satisfy our bodies' craving for electrolytes.  Ok, so Del Taco isn't fine dining, but when you're tired, hungry, and demoralized from fighting through stupid wind on your bicycle, comfort fast food does the trick.  (The restroom was clean too, yay!)
1	This was the most bizarre Del Taco experience I've ever had. I love love love Del Taco, as referenced in previous reviews  . But a single employee ruined what should have been a nice quick lunch for me today.As I sat down at the other end of the seating area, I immediately heard someone talking very loudly about homeless people. Random. I turned to look and it was an employee, presumably on break, talking across two tables to an elderly customer. I started to eat, and quickly realized this wasn't going to get any better.The employee talked LOUDLY for the next 20 minutes about how homeless people deserve to be homeless because of their choices, and she doesn't give them money because she has her own family to feed, and how tax payers pay for the homeless.Everyone's entitled to their opinions, but having a crazy employee yelling across a restaurant was so unprofessional and rude. I ate as quickly as I could and left.
