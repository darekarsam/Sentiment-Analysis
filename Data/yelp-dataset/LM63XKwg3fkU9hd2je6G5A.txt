5	MarkieChar Jewelry is exactly what Tivoli needed. Upstairs above the MarketCafe, snuggled in the corner is this gem of a store. Specializing in pieces you cant find at your run of the mill jewelry store, and way higher quality than a boutique clothing store. Thin golds, beautiful rings, leather bracelets, infinity signs, and so much more. This is my go to to get my amazing little Sis a new item, something that doesn't empty my wallet, is high quality, and she can have forever. I have bought a few gifts here, both mens and women's and each time they are packaged beautifully and the customer service is 100%. I love answering those calls from my sister at college that she LOVES what I picked out and she won't be taking it off =)The layout makes it easy to see everything, and makes me feel like I am exploring someones personal collection, very warm and inviting. I will definitely be back anytime I need a unique, high quality gift for someone I love.
3	Cute spot in the Market LV.  Limited selection but they have a few gems (har, har).  I spotted some cute druzy quartz rings, rose gold bracelets, and agate slice necklaces.  Mostly, their stuff consists of dainty jewelry.  I'd prefer some edgier selections, but, it's cool.  I see potential.
