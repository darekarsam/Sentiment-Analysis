3	Great location and a lot of good programs offered for little kids just beginning soccer. But, our five year old is currently on the winter league and our experience has not been great. First game, our coach never showed. The schedule for games is not online, or if it is, impossible to find. No instruction or guidance given during the games. But maybe bc its just a winter league? Also, no longer get a t-shirt for registering...we had to come up with our own orange shirt (which we didn't have, so bought one.) Overall, its a good place to start but could be better.
5	I'm a huge supporter of the Strikers' walls for young kids. I have seen how young players develop ball skills quickly with the small walled fields. I find it convenient to have the year round leagues and camps.
4	We are new to the area but really enjoyed our first season w/Strikers.  Super nice office staff & they really seem to love the game & encourage the kids to Have fun & enjoy the game.  The format is slightly different...more like an indoor set up w/the walls but it makes for a faster/always moving game & helps to improve skills at a faster pace.
