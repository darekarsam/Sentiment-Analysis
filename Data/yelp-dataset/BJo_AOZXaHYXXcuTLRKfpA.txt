2	It's a great community. It's on a busy street, so if your loved one is a little "confused" at times, just be aware of that. The people who live there are wonderful. The management has a few kinks to work out, but the nurse practitioner, the ladies at All Care services, all wonderful people.I want to stress here though that the management is terrible. They change hands so frequently that it just becomes ridiculous to expect any kind of consistency or organization. There is a kind of creepy right wing Republican vibe from one manager, who desperately wants to get rid of the "freeloaders" (anyone who gets any kind of benefits, which is just insane in an environment like this!) **Yes, I'm looking at YOU Mrs. Crane!** then an easy going, "let's see what we can work out for you" the next month. It's extremely unfortunate and I wish it weren't so. Dealing with them is like being stuck inside a yo-yo. If it weren't for this huge liability, this community could be much more successful,  appealing, and desirable. I know it must be a very competitive market in Phoenix for senior care, but I just think this place is the absolute pits when it comes to their business practices. Not a lot of integrity. I can't speak for the entire Holiday organization, as I have heard tremendous things about other locals in other cities/towns, but this one seriously needs some expert advisors to give them a bleepin' clue!
2	There are good points to this place but the management turn over is less than a year. My mom just discovered bed bugs in her room and another resident said she had them six months ago. Although they called the exterminators right away, the best they could offer my mom was to stay in a vacant room with a cot. And when I picked her up to stay with me for the night, they had no idea how long she needed to be away from her room (one day - one week).Besides that, my mom loves the food and All Care Services have been very nice and helpful with managing my mom's medications.
