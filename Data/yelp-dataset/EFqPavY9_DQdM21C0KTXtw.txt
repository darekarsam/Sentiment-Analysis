5	Loved the setting, the ambiance was inviting and the staff was great. Excellent coffee and cappuccino. The croissant was very good. The bagel with cream cheese was delicious ...
1	Short changes Foreign Tourists. BewareWe bought a coffee here and the cashier shortchanged us $5.  We were tired and not familiar with the money at a glance.
1	The food at these shops is terrible. It is like eating airplane food. Salty, bland, thoughtless. Do yourself a favor, spend your money somewhere that cares a little about quality.
4	Walked by here for so long without knowing it exists.Glad I tried it since it's one of the larger coffee shops, it fits in with the street it's on as it's quieter than most coffee shops.Large windows and varied seats and a little isolated area is pretty cool.I'm a Starbucks fan so the coffee is not my fave, but the price and selection are decent.
