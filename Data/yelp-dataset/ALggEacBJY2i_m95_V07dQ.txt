3	This place is pretty good. Like the other reviewer said, a pretty good variety of bulk things. Spices, teas, a good selection of medicinal herbs, nuts and dried fruits.  Nothing organic, but other than that, no complaints. If you're looking for something, you'll probably find it here.
4	Great place. Cheapest fleur du sel in the city and wonderful array of spices and mixes. Tandoori spice and za'atar mixes are great! They also have hard-to-find and inexpensive citric acid and pectin for canning/jarring. Rating Scale:1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one?3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible.5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here.
5	Amazing selection of spices and dry goods, at very, very reasonable prices by any standards.
4	Very affordable and friendly spice shop on St Laurent in Little Italy, right near Milano and Jean Talon Market which makes for a sweet little foodie shopping afternoon. You want to accept the help offered here since the place is crammed and works according to it's own logic, let the kind folks help you, they won't steer you astray. If you can't find it here, try Spice Station down on Bernard, but most needs will be comfortably met at Anatol.
