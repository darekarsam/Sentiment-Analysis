1	I would give the place a higher rating of a 3 except for the fact that Montrealers annoylingly rave about this place almost as much as they do about their bagels. Its nothing special. Each time I'm dragged there the service isn't great and the food is only OK.
2	Food's good but the service sucks, parking sucks and the food is mediocre. The place across the street, Eggs Frutti, is far better and kicking the business out of this place.Chez Cora better step up its game if it plans on staying in business.This place is so overrated, it's no longer enjoyable!
3	I like the concept of this breakfast style restaurant, lots of pretty fruit on every plate.Food was tasty.Price was as expected.Salads are only Monday-Friday?Booth was a sticky mess.Service was a bit slow, had to keep flagging the waitress down, in the beginning, but it got better towards the end.
3	There's isn't much to say about Chez Cora. I think it is a reasonable spot, in line with most chain places that mostly focus on breakfast. I do like their buckwheat crepes and that is usually what I will order (buckwheat crepes wrapped around bananas that are smothered in peanut butter, served with crunchy granola). Paired with a large cup of water because their coffee makes Dunkin Donuts coffee seems good. I mostly go here because it is right across from Loblaws and even though chez Cora is a tad pricy it is cheaper than me going into the supermarket on an empty stomach!
5	I did enjoy my breakfast. Nice and clean...The service was really good and definitely i will come here sooon
1	Walked out after not getting our food while our waitress took her break a few tables over and watched us wait. Waited a half an hour. Oh, by the way, the place was empty with three waitresses and two cooks. WON'T go back.
