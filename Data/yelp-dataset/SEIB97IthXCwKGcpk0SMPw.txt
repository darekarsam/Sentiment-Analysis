5	I have been using Maria Isabel for over a year.  She goes all over the Valley. She is reliable. professional and has reasonable rates.  She always shows up at the agreed upon time and, if there is a problem she calls or texts me. She brings her crew and does the white tornado treatment, top to bottom on my house.  When she leaves, everything is sparkling clean and smells and feels so fresh. I highly recommend Maria as she does a wonderful job.
5	Maria is AWESOME!  She's been cleaning our house for nearly 3 years and has always done a great job. She and her team pay attention to the details so no need to remind them about things. She's always on time and is happy to work around my crazy schedule if needed. We're so happy to have found her and I always appreciate my friend Becky who recommended her.  Obviously I highly recommend Maria!!
5	I have had them cleaning my house for about 5 years.  This is the longest I have ever kept a house cleaning service. She is always prompt and pays attention to the little details. She and her staff are always happy and friendly. I trust her to come while I am out and never question what she doing.  Even if something is missed, when I mention it, it is corrected and it never happens again. I have given her name to many people who after using her agree she is great!  I would recommend her always!
