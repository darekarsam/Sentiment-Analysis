4	They have a $9.95 buffet for lunch weekdays. Quality of food was good, tasty although on the mild side.  The place is nice with large windows on Prince-Arthur. Service was attentive and nice which is especially noteworthy for a buffet. Their a-la carte menu is interesting with some typical western fare adapted with Indian ingredients such as the "Tandoori Club Sandwich" and the "Kebab Burger with mint-tamarind chutney". Worth visiting is you are around.
1	I completely understand that this place closed shorty after its opening. It was the worst Indian food I've had in Canada.   Flavourless.
