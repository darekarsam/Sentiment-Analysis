4	I stopped in hoping to get a pair of shorts altered but I found out they don't do alterations. Being a guy you think all this stuff goes together. The staff was helpful in recommending some nearby places that should be able to help me. I noticed the barrage of items plastered all over the walls & I think I found a good place to have 2 of my portraits canvased. I'll letcha know when I have it done so my review will actually mean something
5	What amazing service...and really cared!  My sons team lost his jersey and we were scrambling last minute to get him a number on the only one left. I called Bowdacious and they took such good care of us last minute. I would highly recommend them!!
