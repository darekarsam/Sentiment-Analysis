4	The service was very good: attentive, efficient & friendly. We really enjoyed our dinners. Dau had chicken lo mein; good noodles with big chunks of tender chicken that was perfectly sauced. Hubby and u split a roll and some pad Thai. I liked the roll; the pad Thai was ok. I loved the seviche the best; quite inventive and nicely spiced.
5	It just happened to be a coincidence that the section of the street that this restaurant is on was closed this past Saturday due to a street party.  It was hard to get to the restaurant but I had parked on a block behind Washington.  We were greeted and seated very quickly and we had to go over the menu a few times because there were a lot of choices to make between appetizers, sushi, noodles, hot pots etc.  The menu has a really nice variety of Asian dishes and it was hard to choose from them but we did eventually make our choice.  They had a good choice of beers on tap and even had a variety of special sake.We had started with the garlic and basil deep fried wings and the steamed dumplings which didn't take that long to come out.  The wings were cooked properly, through and through.  The sauce and spice were very good.  I can't say I've had wings like this before, saucy yet crunchy but the sauce along with the basil was such a unique taste.  The steamed dumplings were as expected but the meat had a very good taste.  Again, perfectly cooked... chewy outside and not soggy at all.  The appetizers were wonderful.  Our server had asked us if we wanted the sushi ahead of the pots and I had said yes.  I had ordered 2 rolls... a twin dragon roll and a crazy gaga roll.  If I recall correctly the twin dragon had both lobster and shrimp and the gaga was a spicy tuna with salmon and jalepeno on top.  The quality of the rolls, fish and construction was great.  As far as rolls go these were both well done.  Lastly we had ordered two hot pots.  The menu is full of a variety of hot pots (a dozen or more) some of which have a choice of which meat you would like from chicken, beef, seafood or veal.I had ordered the hot sauce beef and my wife had ordered the Hawaii Five 0 which is a mixed seafood pot.  Each pot gave us a choice of rice (white, brown and another I can't remember).  TIP:  Each pot is enough to feed 2 to 3 people but each is only served with a single serving rice.  The pots are absolutely huge. If I had known how large the serving was I would have just ordered one to share instead of two.  Great if you want to take it out afterwards.The food at Jade Grille was superb.  I've had my fair share of Asian food from many Asian restaurants and I have to say this place served a good variety of tasty food.  Overall the experience was top notch.  The server was very helpful and attentive.  The ambiance was good with the nice soft lighting, good tunes and great food.  I would definitely return to the Jade Grille the next time we return to Pittsburgh.
5	Take a trip to Mt Lebanon and stop in at the most amazing, authentic and visually appealing Chinese Food Experience that you will ever enjoy.Jade Grill has brought Authentic Chinese Dishes to Pittsburgh.  You won't fine General Tso or Hunan Beef...what you will find is appetizers such as Pickled Vegetables, Lamb & Chicken Skewers, Hand Made (at time of order) Steamed Dumplings and much more.  For meals, you can choose from Soups that include 40 feet of hand pulled noodles (and if you don't believe it, ask to watch), Entrees that can include, Beef, Chicken, Lamb, Shrimp or Seafood.  And so much more.I opted for the Dry Pot...This was so amazing...it was full of a mix of flavors and then the heat...oh the heat.  Not for the faint of heart but I have to tell you, the burn does go away and you are left with the need to go back in for more.Part of me doesn't want to expose this incredible gem hidden on RT 19, but the reality is that I want everyone to go away with satisfaction that I have right now....and I am already planning my next visit.Thank you so much Jade Grill for opening my eyes to "real" Chinese cuisine.
2	I would try Jade Grille again, just for the Pad Thai.There were only two other tables seated when we walked in at 6:15ish.  The place looks great, but the servers aren't well trained and the hostess looked like she wanted to be anywhere else.  We were seated and given menus that weren't the same.  Got two "updated menus" after asking which one was the right one to be using.  Ordered food.  Asked that my two small plates be served with my husband's dinner. Got my Szechuan Spring Roll in like 5 minutes.  It was hot, and crunchy, that's it.  No flavor, no nothing, even with the duck sauce.  The other small plate I ordered came with my husband's Pad Thai. The Ocean Roll was described as cucumber, tuna, and salmon wrapped in cucumber. What I was served was faux crab, avocado, tuna and salmon wrapped in cucumber.  I do not like the first two things I just listed, and had they been in the description, I would not have ordered the dish. They did make me a new order with just the cucumber, tuna and salmon, which was good.  The highlight of the meal though was the Pad Thai!!  We ended up sharing the Pad Thai.  When the bill came, the amount we were charged was different from the menu price, and we were told "Oh, I'll let them know about it." but the price wasn't changed on the bill.  Overall, I think they are suffering from "new restaurant" issues and I would be willing to go back in a few months and give them an other try.
2	My daughter and I had the beef fried rice and the Pad Thai, respectively. Both were dry and rather tasteless. Mine was allegedly Veggie Pad Thai, but there were only four small pieces of broccoli, a handful of onions, and some chives. I will give them another try, but was quite disappointed this time.
5	We went there for the first time last night. The food was excellent.  The smoked tea duck might be the best duck I've had in a restaurant.  My wife got the tangerine orange steak and that was delicious as well.  Their cocktail list is original.  The service was very good. The setting was nice, lively but not too loud.  We'll definitely be going back. The quality of food, drink, and experience for the price was impressive.
3	First impression is the place is not packed. Saw 3 wait staffs serving about 4 to 5 tables. Great menu for HOT Chinese food.Didn't serve great portions to the choice of Sichuan style dry pot that we ordered. In fact there were 5 times more other stuff than chunks of chicken, which serves as the meat element of the main dish. Size and stomach-stuffing ability is generally not great, excluding sushi, which is sadly about the same everywhere.Sushi was decent, but not as excellent as the price tag would justify, at least for some of the selections.Overall selection of food category is great, very comprehensive.Food is on average 3.5 out of 5 authentic to the corresponding Chinese provincial styles, which is already somewhat of a rare bird in the Pittsburgh area.In conclusion, try it out for yourself to see if the price+atmosphere justifies the satisfaction. Approximate spending per capita is 30 for first-timers. PS, parking is a huge hassle.
5	I would say it's a even better place compared with HaoLee. The cook from Chengdu my hometown really masters the essence of Szechuan dishes. The flavor of the food was so good that made one of my friends kind of homesick. And for me the food definitely qualifies the level of excellence. I haven't trie other styles of food so I cannot comment with that. But the design of the restaurant itself is so decent and the idea of opening up that bar area is actually nice. A word of advice would be to start serving cold dishes at the bar for the beer. In general this restaurant is fantastic especially for those enjoying Chinese style hot/spicy food!
4	The food was pretty good! The pad Thai was a bit vinegary, but that was the first time I had it, so I'm not sure how it's supposed to be. I got the jade grill hot pot. The flavones weren't complex but they were yummy and satisfying. Both meals were big enough to share!
3	I found this testimonial on the Jade Grille website doesn't say enough about the place. 9th grade Latin fails me.    "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aliquam et consectetur mauris. Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus. Praesent blandit faucibus ullamcorper."
5	Chinese food, service and environment worth the 5 star. And, you need to pay a 5 star price for these, too.
5	In my opinion, the best Chinese restaurant in the South Hills. Authentic and an eclectic menu. I've eaten here 5 times, and the clientele is shifting.  Today large numbers of Chinese guests and no nonAsians. Not surprising since the cook is from Chendu (near Sichuan) and he seems imprevious to requests. Every time that I have visited with guests, we asked the dishes to be less "hot" ie decrease the numbers of red hot peppers and as far as I can tell, the dishes remained "hot" and the number of red peppers seemed excessive given our reguest.   The prices are relatively high compared to Red Tea House and Sesame Inn.That said, I love Sichuan food and "hot" dishes. Simple Chinese dishes are great including steamed pork dumplings, shrimp dumplings, the small soups (eg seafood corn chowder)  and large bowls of noodle soup. And I recommend these dishes for nonAsians - they are delicious and low-priced.  The hand-pulled noodle dishes are exceptional and compare favorably with Everyday Noodles in Squirrel Hill.The wok dishes are the delicious highlight of the restaurant.  I will expand on my review once I have sampled more of them. Service is outstanding.
4	Pros: Nice atmosphere. It's definitely one of the fancier Sichuan restaurant in Pittsburgh. Food is great. There are lots of Asian faces, so you can tell that they serve authentic Sichuan food (if you order from the Chinese menu). Cons: A little bit pricey, comparing to other Sichuan restaurants in the city.
3	The food and service here were above average. The selection left a little to be desired at some high prices. The restaurant was comfortable but parking is certainly an issue in the bustling uptown area.I would like to see Jade Grille expand their menu offerings to appeal to a wider audience.
2	The dumplings were amazing, but nothing else I ordered seemed too special. The food was fine, I just expected more for the price and after having the stellar dumplings as an appetizer. The service is what I found lacking. For some reason, the hostess took our main course order, which is fine, but my order was incorrect. (I ordered an entree and was brought out a 1/2 cup bowl of soup) No big deal, I was fine to wait another 10 minutes for my food, but I was shocked that not one of the 4 people that interacted with me about the mishap ever offered any sort of apology (Not the waitress, the hostess, the food busser, or the other person that came out from the kitchen to double check that they got it right the second time, in fact I kinda felt like they tried to convince me that I messed up and I DID actually order a teeny bowl of soup for my entree.) Usually when an order gets screwed up, a good restaurant wont charge you for that item, or they will take one of your drinks off the bill. Not only did that not happen, I wasn't even given a simple apology, so I think they need to work on their customer service standards. Oh, and also, we overheard one waitress say to another "Im gonna kill someone" as she was walking away from another table. I understand working in the service industry can make you want to kill people, but really, save that talk for the kitchen.
3	Food was hit and miss.  Sushi was very good.  Crab soup was ok.  Edemamme was, well hard to screw that up.  The Hot Sauce dish was the issue with our meal.  First, I have to say that it was a huge portion.  Enough for three people to share.  The main problem was the flavor and ungodly amour of oil(see picture). Was very salty and had some spice and that was about the entire flavor profile of the dish.The service was good.  Not too friendly, but prompt and to the point.Based on the sushi, I would try again.
2	Sort of a disappointing experience. I came here with 4 others on a Friday night around 7pm. with reservations and the place didn't  appear to look like it was very bust so I can only guess that the  poor service experience we had was attributed to short handed staffing??? Who knows??? Our server did a decent job but we received each item and very long intervals. They gave us a dish that was obviously not ours and the server took it back and we  waited such a long time that we simply told her that we didn't want it. It actually still  arrived and they boxed it up for us but gave it to us on the house which was  nice. I thought that the food was alright but certainly not worth what we paid for  it. 3 Shoshito peppers for around 9$. That's a little steep considering you can buy a pound for that price and I could certainly cook them better than these. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.
4	I would highly recommend takeout. Food was great! Try the Lo mein! But terrible service.
5	Every time I eat here it's just an all around wonderful experience. From the great staff to the relaxed ambiance to the delicious food, there is really nothing bad I can say about Jade Grille. I would highly recommend the hot sauce chicken, handmade dumplings and the string bean dish. They also have some unique cocktails you can't find anywhere else, try the basil berry martini or the samurai! Jade Grille is definitely one of my new favorites in the south hills.
5	Finally got a chance to go, after the word had spread among all my friends that there was a new Chinese restaurant opened. It was very clean, nice decor, Good service. Well most importantly, we were happy about the Sichuan cuisine there.
5	Great meal. Very authentic Chinese - best I've had since my last visit to China. The Sichaun Dumpling are worth the visit on their own. Service very helpful and attentive as well.
5	Some best Chinese cuisine you can find in Pittsburgh! Great decoration! Love the room with a door that looks like the kind that you may find in bank vaults.
4	I've been wanting to check this place out for a while and was finally able to have dinner here last night.  As a small plate, I ordered the mini pork dumplings.  I had read positive reviews about their dumplings so wanted to try them for myself.  Unfortunately, I wasn't a fan.  When you bit in to them or cut them a soupy substance leaked through...perhaps they're meant to be that way but the texture didn't sit well with me.  I also thought the soy ginger sauce they provided with the dumplings was too vinegary.For my main entree, I ordered the Garlic Basil Wok with Chicken and brown rice.  This dish was very flavorful and there was plenty of chicken morsels (not too big) that were tender and fresh.  You could see garlic gloves and basil leaves throughout the dish.  My only wish for the dish would have been to have some veggies - but it didn't mention that the dish had veggies, so I can't really be upset about that.  My friend had the avocado lobster salad small plate and said it was great and tried the fried rice and was equally satisfied.  I'll definitely be back again to check out their other options.  The decor is very modern and the restaurant itself seems quite spacious.  Love the bank door for the private room.
4	This is a brand new restaurant in Mt. Lebanon. I was expecting a crowd, but it was just us on a Sunday afternoon. Quiet and peaceful, though probably not good for business. Friends of ours had recommended that we try the handmade dumplings, so we ordered those and the Szechuan dumplings. They are very different from each other! The Szechuan dumplings were like boiled potstickers that were in a garlic soy sauce, and though very garlicky, they were still good. The handmade steamed dumplings were fabulous! Be sure to get some extra fresh ginger right alongside those yummy pockets of goodness.The next course was my staple order of a shrimp tempura roll and an Alaskan roll, just so I could compare in my sushi competition of life. Very good, though Jade Grill will not take a place in my top three. If I had to rate them for anything, it would be the dumplings. They were very notable. The service was wonderful, but again, we were the only ones there. Our waitress was extremely knowledgable. She shared some chef secrets and helped to debunk a question about shrimp tails. They have a great wine and liquor selection, and several craft beers on tap. I hope they get more busines, as I think there is great potential here.
5	Best Chinese restaurant in town! Great environment, great taste, great service, and reasonable price. LOVE it!
3	My husband and i visited jade grille on a friday evening at 7:00. The place was almost empty but beautifully decorated.  We ordered 3 sushi rolls, and one noodle entree and one authetic chinese dish. Everthing was just average. Although we enjoyed our visit, there are other Asian restaurants within walking distance that i would go to before coming back. Our waitress was very sweet but was unable to answer questions about the menu but this may be because of the language barrier and not so much being unfamiliar with the food.
5	Who knew: outstanding, authentic Szechuan food in Mt. Lebanon. Stick to the "real Chinese" part of the menu and you'll get fresh, delicious, deep-flavored food. Our favorite was the fish hot pot. The steamed buns (soup dumplings) were also excellent. Much of it is spicy but not unmanageable. One of the most authentic and best "ethnic" food experiences in the Pittsburgh area.
5	My husband is a Chinese native and has always complained when in town visiting that Mt. Lebanon/South Hills does not have any real Chinese restaurants. Jade Grille is as real and authentic as it gets. Their soup dumplings are just like the ones we have when visiting China. So good! We try and make it to Jade Grille every chance we get.
5	Outstanding.  Try the sweet peppers appetizer.  Best restaurant in my. Leno by far.  Great atmosphere as well.
