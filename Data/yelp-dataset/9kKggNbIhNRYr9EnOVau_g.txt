5	My session with C Love Jordan was one of best and most comprehensive reading I have received. Sometimes we need confirmation from the past to prompt us to go forward in this journey of life! Excellent, is only a humbled compliment! Namaste
5	Min. C. Love Jordan and her husband Truth are amazing!!! I have had 3 reiki treatments, a few readings, a life path session, attended her mantra Monday sessions along with spirit circles she host. I always leave her presence fulfilled and with a wealth of new knowledge. Let me give you a heads up a reading is good but you will quickly find out that the LIFE PATH session is the way to go. I learned more about myself in a 1 hour session than I thought I knew & it changed my world. If you are looking for spiritual guidance or just want to know if you're on the right path look no further.....go directly to Min. C. Love Jordan!
5	C.Love is a wonderful spiritual guide. She is inspirational yet truthful in her analysis. She assisted me in seeing the positive in my most difficult of moments. Her insights are uncanny. I highly recommend her guidance.
5	I was looking for a medium to do a reading for me and my mom.  Love was recommended by a good friend and I am so grateful I got to meet her and be a part of such an amazing experience.  Love has a truly special gift and I was in awe of not only that gift but of her presence.  She has a such a calm, loving aura and I felt so comfortable with her right away.  I am looking forward to doing a Reiki session with her soon.
5	C. Love Jordan is a truly gifted and intuitive healer and teacher. One could not ask for a more wonderful spiritual guide. Just her presence inspires confidence and trust. Whatever your healing or spiritual needs, you could not find a better person to help guide you along your path.She is my Reiki Master teacher and has provided me wonderful Reiki healing. She is a spiritual jewel of the first-order.  Give her a try. I guarantee you won't be sorry.
