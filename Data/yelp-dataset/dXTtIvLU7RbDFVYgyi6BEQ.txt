4	Classic simple lovely old bar out on Mont Royal, with wood touches in an art deco style, dim attractive lighting, friendly prompt service and a very well-stocked bar. If you come when there is no show you can sit in the comfortable chairs on the wide wooden stage against the window. Come for live music and take in some of the best emerging local franco music around. Verre Bouteille also has free wifi and a snack menu that sounds delish, though I haven't tried it yet.

The prices are really decent - since this is the East-o'-Papineau part of Mont-Royal where everything gets slightly cheaper and slightly weirder.I have yet to see a show here, but I really like the way the space is set up for it. They seem to get a couple of bands a month, though the website looks kind of slow for shows at the moment... It is the absolute perfect size though, large enough for a crowd, small enough to be an intimate setting.As for summer, there is no terrace, but in typical Ave Mont-Royal pub style, the front window opens wide for a bit of a breeze. For me it's more of a cozy winter spot anyway.The servers are always welcoming and friendly, and you know I love that.They lose one star because I think the menu could be ever so slightly more interesting, but I have snacked to satisfaction here on one or two occasions.
