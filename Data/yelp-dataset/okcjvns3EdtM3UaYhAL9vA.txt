4	I recently met the owner of this store after being totally doted on by an associate while I tried making some pretty tough decisions around CHOCOLATE =) I must admit I'm a fan and this is one of my new favorite places to visit when I make it back to Pittsburgh.  Not only are the sweet treats fabulous, the customer service is exceptional and sweet just like their treats!
4	Looking for some olde fashion fun in every bite?  Stop by the sweet shop and grab some fudge, fancy caramel applies, fancy chocolates or just get some delicious gelatto.
5	The Sweet Shoppe & Nut House is a cute store with sweets for every craving. The apples are delicious, the fudge is yummy, and they have all kinds of different gelato. They even take special orders for all kinds of occasions, from weddings to birthdays. The owner and workers are all very nice and helpful. It is a fun place for everyone!
5	This is such a nice place to being friends, family, yourself!! The gelato is out of this world... Made in store. You can have a private party here for adults after hours...bring the wine!  I love the fudge and classics they sell as well. They make great candy apples...that must be their specialty. I light up like a child every time I walk into this place. There is nowhere else like iron our town!!
4	Very delightful place - we ate the gelato and though it was a bit messy for the kids they were very polite and welcoming.
5	Went there for a couple gifts. The staff was so helpful and nice. They put the extra touches on the packaging. They provided helpful suggestions with out being pushy. While the prices may seem high at first when you compare them to other high end chocolate shops they were $15 a pound lower for truffles. Very satisfied and will return.
1	So disappointed - What they sell is not gelato.  It is the consistency of a thin milkshake & lacked flavor.  Candy is nothing special, similar to what you find at giant eagle. Will not stop by again.
