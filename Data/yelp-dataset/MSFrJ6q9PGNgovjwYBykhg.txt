4	Give yourself plenty of time when you go.  It took us 45 minutes before we were taken back for the CT scan.Aside from the waiting, the staff was friendly and helpful and that outweighed the bad
3	Wife was here for an appointment...got called back so me being her husband was planning on gping with. I was stopped and told no I couldnt go back.....wasnt told why ....my first concern was if this guy nurse was assisting my wife....I need to be there...no way is a male doing this without me. He was rude. However a nice lady came out and explained why I cant be with my wife. If that would have happened in the first place all would jave been well.. so all you devoted husbands that plan on being here for your wife....it wont happen. They wont let it. Wait it out in the waiting area.....
