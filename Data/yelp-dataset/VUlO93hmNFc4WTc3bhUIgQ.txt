5	I use this branch often.  Since it's on the way to the gym for me I like to stop here to conduct my financial transactions often.  Today I had to go inside and use a live teller.The line was short and she was very friendly and pleasant.  I was 3rd in line when I arrived and was in/out in 5 minutes.  Awesome!Not much more to say about this branch other than it's pretty laid back and the employees are fast and efficient.Will I return?  For my financial sake....I hope so!
1	Want to deal with a smug branch manager? I suggest Sean. He is less than pleasant, disrespectful and definitely had complete disregard for anyone's time but his own. My bi-monthly transactions require managers approval. I have been banking here for 3 years. As of lately, I have been waiting 25-30 min just to complete 1 transaction!!! I am usually the only vehicle in the drive through. So, today, I decided to go in and see if it would be quicker inside. It took 18 min. I walked right up to a teller. The majority of the wait was explaining the situation (same as it is EVERY time I go in) to 3 different people, to ultimately wait for Sean. He snidely educated me as to why I need managers approval (which duh I know I have done this more than 60 times) in a very condescending manner. I asked if there was anything I could do to make to process smoother, or if a note could be added to my account to speed up the process. Sean's beady eyes looked up at me and told me that the solution was to not do my transactions this way. Completely rude. No person deserves to be so miserable, pompous, or conceited. Hey, Sean, never look down on anyone, unless you are helping them up. It must be nice to be important, but MUCH more important to be nice. And, if you spit fire, expect to get burned.
1	The teller was inefficient and unprofessional. The store manager just stood back and watch. I will never return to this branch.
