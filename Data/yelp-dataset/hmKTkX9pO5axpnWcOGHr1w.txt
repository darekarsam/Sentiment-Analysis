4	Wow, new Little Ceasars just opened up and had to try it out.  Looks really nice and clean inside, the staff was super friendly and the pizza was great.
1	Simply the worst wings I've ever tried in my life.  Just awful.  They were rubbery (do they cook them in a microwave?) and small.  The "butter" garlic sauce was some sort of petroleum-tasting margarine that even my dogs weren't excited to chomp on (and they eat their own poop).  The lemon-pepper wings also had a very strange artificial taste to them, and equally rubbery.The pizza is pretty much just a huge pile of bland dough with minimal amounts of toppings.  They must use a high-precision laster to cut pepperoni that thin.I wouldn't take it as free food.
2	There was a hair baked into my pizza. My crazy bread had literally no seasoning. Very disappointing. Went back to explain, they have me a new pizza which was fine but the second crazy bread they gave me was worse then the first one! I want CRAZY bread not dull bread..
4	Here it is, Hot and Ready! This is the best bang for your buck in the pizza world. This location is always Johnny on the spot for those nights when there is no time to cook dinner.  The kids that work there are always cool with me, and as quick as a pizza goes out they have another one coming out.$5 for a pepperoni, in a hurry and on the go......can't beat it.
5	First time since I was a kid to eat Little Cesar's... Wonderful food and great staff!  I was up in the area by myself and didn't need a whole pizza; I'm a Realtor and was in the area checking on a house.  I was hoping for the lunch special I noticed on TV for $5... But it was 2:20pm and that special ends at 2pm.  The gal was great on the phone and said she'd throw one in the oven for me just this once.  Great staff!!!
