5	What a Great find!  Never had filet mignon and eggs for breakfast before. Good price and better service :-)
5	Sometime in the recent past, the old place caught on fire and the old place was destroyed. After some time they rebuilt Chateau d'Or in its stead.The place is very nice from the exterior and the interior is very esthetically pleasing. Kindly note the parking outside is a bit problematic as parking is limited and in my humble opinion, terrible done with an uneven surface that can provide you an Olympic sized swimming pool to avoid carefully or practice for Sochi.I was visiting a friend and went with the simple burger and fries and WHAT A BURGER it is! It's huge, the meat patties is thick and juice, the condiments fresh and tasty.... and the sesame bun is probably the best type of bun one can ask for. It was a nice treat!The side fries were crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside... I didn't know you can eat so well in Boisbriand!!! The coleslaw was amazing as well, creamy and decadent, you'll be craving for more as you polish the plate.The service was amiable and attentive and the price-tag very negotiable.  WILL BE BACK!
5	Best greasy spoon full meal diner in the area!And best greek salads!!!
