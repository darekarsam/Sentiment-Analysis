2	As much as I love KFC, this store is very disappointing.  In the drive-through I didn't get a receipt and they only gave me half my order.  Luckily the manager was nice and helped me sort things out when I drove back and went inside.  She admitted things weren't going smoothly that day.  But make sure you get a receipt and check your orders before you leave!  Colonel Sanders definitely wouldn't approve of the level of service here.
3	I like all KFCs but tend to frequent this one for lunch. No matter which store you go to, the food is fairly consistent and the service always varies. Sometimes they're real nice, other times they're a-holes. A few days ago I happened to stop by at lunch, and well, low and behold; the gal at the drive through - total jerk. Can I just get a lil' hot sauce and ketchup with my order? Sheesh! Anywhooooo, we all know the fried chicken, popcorn chicken, mashed potatoes are pretty solid, so let's skip that for now. Do you remember all of the Oprah giveaways? I've never been to her show to get a new car or anything, but I was one of the lucky millions of people who got down with some free grilled chicken. Surprisingly, KFC's grilled chicken is pretty dang good. The only downside is that the chicken doesn't appear to be like hormone injected or juiced up on steroids like Ronnie from Jersey shore. They pieces are noticeably smaller than the fried chicken. Either way, yummy nonetheless.
2	I love KFC,  my favorite place for chicken. however,  on my last 3 visits  my waiting time has been 10 or more minutes waiting in the drive thru. They take the  order pretty quick but the waiting for the food part, is ridiculous. They don't have grill chicken most of the time around 12:00pm. I still come to this location, because is the one closer to home and work.
