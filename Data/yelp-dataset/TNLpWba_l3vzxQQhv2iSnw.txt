5	Dr Smith and the staff at Eye Care for Animals do a great job of caring for my 11 year old blind diabetic Italian Greyhound.  They are friendly and take the time to explain everything and answer all your questions.  I highly recommend they to anyone who has a pet with vision problems.
5	Excellent care. My dog was referred over by his primary doctor for cloudiness in his eye. The clinic is very clean, there are refreshments for both critters and their chauffeurs. The receptionist was very sweet and friendly, as was the vet tech. Dr. Smith was very amiable and very affectionate to my dog. He swiftly ruled out some things we were concerned about and came to a diagnosis right away. While the combination of problems were unusual for his breed and unusual for both to occur together, he said the eye drops should clear up the problems in a few weeks with no permanent issues. Hooray! I feel confident my animals are in good care here. Animal ophthalmologists aren't  a dime a dozen, so feel privileged that we have such good choices in our town! (And no, I don't work for these guys! Haha.)
5	My furbaby has been one mess after another the past year.Our case was very time sensitive, and they squeezed us in right away on a referral from the neurologist. I've never felt rushed or that I was an annoyance to anyone there. The staff and Dr. Smith have always been very kind to both my dog and her humans. Dr. Smith really listened to everything we had to tell him, and with his help we were able to bring back my dog's eyesight. On a future date, he was able to save her eyes again from a seriously nasty, fast-moving infection. Had they not been quick to fit us in that day (Friday) and had Dr. Smith not been so smart in his approach, even the small wait from Friday to Monday may have cost her the eyesight we had fought so hard to get back. We are very grateful to everybody in that office. They've made a real impact on the quality of life for my sweet girl.
