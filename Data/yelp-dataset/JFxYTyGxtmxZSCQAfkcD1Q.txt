4	I would normally just give three stars to a train station, but this one was somehow impeccable clean than the other stations I have been to that day. My train was on-time, and since I arrived early, I even had time to get a milkshake. Signage was more than enough, and connections are easy to do. The only thing I didn't like was that restrooms were paid, which is typically okay, but they were on the separate system than the one in Berlin. Hence, my 0,50 EUR coupon for a piss which I got in Berlin wasn't honored here.
