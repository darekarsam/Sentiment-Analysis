4	Helpful customer service folks and even extra people on duty when the ATM was down.  If only the real estate aspect of Chase was as good as the banking side.
5	I have honestly had nothing but exceptional service each time I've visited this branch.  Not one person has ever come across as too busy or put out by me, even when I came in with a deposit AT 6:00pm.  I know it is extremely rude to do this and I apologized up and down and if they were bothered, they never once let it be known.I visit this branch on a pretty regular basis due to the location of my office and the necessity for making almost daily deposits and can say they are THE best.  I have used several locations and have been very happy with each one but this one takes the cake.
1	Chase just closed my account for no reason, I went to deposit a check at an ATM and it said to contact customer service, they said I "posed a risk" couldn't tell me why just told me my account was suspended and that they would mail me what was in my account within 7-10 business days!  Didn't know they could close your account without notice or reason, ridiculous!
1	Having lived in the Northeast before moving to Arizona, this place reminded me of the attitude that was so common back in NJ/ NY.Rude, arrogant, cold service. This is Arizona, Chase people! Lighten up a bit! Sheesh. Not coming back to this location.
