5	These guys are seriously great. I moved down to Charlotte from Maine, and this place was recommended. I have a '97 Lincoln Town Car, and it had a myriad of problems. They charged me a very low labor fee to figure out what was wrong with my lights. I'd brought it to multiple garages and they could never figure it out. Well Buffalo tire did, though I wasn't willing to pay for the replacement part since it was worth more than my car. Instead, Louis (my favorite mechanic), worked some 'voodoo' on my car and now my lights work better with just a few minor adjustments, so I can live with my car's handicap until the end of its life. Louis is the best mechanic I've ever had to deal with - I'd ask for him if you go there. Great customer service as well, though don't mind Tom - he's just a bit of a curmudgeon. Also very accommodating, and free wi-fi, so bring your laptop for those long waits.
5	So I went here bcuz my car was running hot they were nice.checkd it out and had me on my way n lil over an hr
5	Came in to have my car inspected after getting a ticket for an expired registration (whoops) I was in and out in 25 minutes. The entire staff was so helpful, and spent time answering my questions about going to the DMV and getting a new registration. I appreciated their time, since the questions really didn't have anything to do with reason I was there. I had an exceptional experience with their sales associate, Anne Kelly. She recommended a few other services for my car while being professional but not pushy. I love these guys!
