5	So easy to pop in here, the Patel's are usually there to help you quickly, whether shipping stuff out or getting a form notarized, they are friendly, efficient and so nice to deal with! They also support the community in little ways, but its the effort that counts!
5	I've been using the UPS Store in Blakeney for my businesses for 2 years and it's been a great experience and resource.  The staff is always friendly and very helpful whether it's for shipping, copying, document scanning, etc.  I highly recommend them.
