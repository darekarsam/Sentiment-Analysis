5	Dr. MacKay is a great people person. His methods get great results. His office is very accommodating, especially with my busy schedule. He is very understanding and willing to work with any situation/condition.
5	Dr. MacKay was very professional.  I am a chronic migraine sufferer.  He has extensive knowledge about migraines, and practices what he preaches on himself and his family (whom HAD) chronic migraines as well.  I plan on going back.  His wife ran the front desk, she was very pleasant and friendly.  Overall very happy.  He doesn't rely on wimpy gizmos and gadgets to adjust.
5	Dropped in on Thursday after a miserable week in lousy hotel beds really tweaked my neck. MacKay Chiropractic took care of me quickly and even helped with my lingering shoulder issue! Feeling amazing today and will be going back anytime I'm in town and in need of an adjustment.
