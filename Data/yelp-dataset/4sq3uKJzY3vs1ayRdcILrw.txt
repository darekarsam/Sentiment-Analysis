5	I've been attending Meck for almost 4 years and its great. There are multiple service times and locations. You can be as involved as you want and the Meck institute offers many classes the help you learn more about the bible and take your faith to the next step. Also they offer Community Care classes for whatever your heart might need. I would suggest just giving it a try and see why so many keep coming back for more.
5	I've been attending Meck for about 6 months. Their children's programs are awesome! My boys come home every Sunday singing songs and telling me all about what they learned. There are multiple campuses if the main campus isn't close to you. Also multiple service times which are very convenient. They offer service opportunities every month to serve local agencies. There are also mission trips outside of the US available for members and attenders.
