3	This Old Navy store is centrally located, smack dab in Eaton Center downtown. It is a large store, taking up a huge space on the second floor. For the most part, it is the same as all any other Old Navy store I've been to in North America, with the same set-up and the same merchandise.Came here to get some Canadian-themed clothing, as I heard they had a lot of stuff with maple leafs, and shirts that said "Montreal" on them, but was disappointed that there was nothing except a few humongous XXL men's shirts with these motifs in the clearance section. A nice guy who worked there said all their Canadiana stuff was sold out pre-Canada Day. Oh well.I liked how this store was large and clean and its various sections were well-marked (although the signage was all in French). My kids and I asked a sales guy to point us in the direction of the teen girl/junior section, and he directed us to the toddler girls area. Not sure he understood us, but that's okay. We liked how the store was organized and how the dressing room area was large and clean, and you can bring up to ten items in to try on. Ten! That's awesome.Unfortunately, we were not thrilled with the long, long line at the cash and how they only had two people manning two cashiers at check-out. They should have called more floor staff to help out at the cash when the line got so long. Also, we weren't thrilled how, after waiting in line for 10 minutes, the cashier told us that the sunglasses we wanted to purchase were full price (nearly $20), when the glasses were on a sale rack and had two different prices listed on its tag (one printed price was for $10 and change). So we left the glasses there (that was the only item we had planned on purchasing).
