2	Super tiny store and the few items that had prices on them were expensive. Why no prices on everything? How do you even compete with online stores or Freddie's slightly bigger selection across the street? Don't see myself hitting this place up again.
5	Incredibly friendly staff!!! Very helpful but not pushy. A good arrange of supplements, and pricing was good. Prices were clearly listed on each item. I will DEFINITELY be back to try the smoothies. Also, if you mention you are an LVAC member, you get a discount! Happy shopping!
5	Thank you Dylan Wright for the awesome experience. Extremely knowledgeable on supplements & thought me a lot about what to and not to take. Super Pharm products are the way to go! Stock up on more of the Peanut butter cup protein pretty please :) oh and the prices here are cheap! Smoothies are half the cost of LVAC's. Oh and Steveo that works at this location is always on point with being 100% with customer service.
2	I rarely review business's but when you walk into a place for the first time and aren't greeted, don't know what products you sell, have higher prices then a place across the street, and then bash them and say 'everyone is coming over here'.. You don't get my business and unfortunately left a bad taste in my mouth in trying a new business out. Train your staff to be friendly, and knowledgeable about the products you sell. Your staff shouldn't say 'it's my second day' sorry I don't know what you're talking about or looking for.'  Set yourself apart from the competitors, offer good service and never talk about your competitors.
