5	The owner is so friendly every time I come in, and they make dropping off & picking up clothes so easy. They also use organic solvents so I can trust that my sensitive skin won't be irritated. I would recommend to anyone looking for a long-term cleaning service!
4	This place is great! A little pricey but they do a great job on our clothes and are always friendly when we come in.
5	The most friendly service you could ever imagine!  And the quality is top notch!  I left another cleaner to come to Happy and love it.
