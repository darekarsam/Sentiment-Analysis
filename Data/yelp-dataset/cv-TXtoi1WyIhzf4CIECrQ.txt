5	I stumbled across Affordable Antiques the other day and I really enjoyed having a browse around. Selling mainly antique furniture there is a great selection on offer and the friendly shop owner advised me that they get knew stock in every week so it's always worth popping back if you're looking for a new wardrobe or dinner table. There were lots of wardrobes and I imagined stepping inside the intricate designs to find myself in Narnia or buying an old writing desk to find a 100 year old love letter hidden in a secret drawer.The prices are very reasonable for the quality of the products on offer and if you're looking to furnish your home then this place is a good shout.
5	Fantastic shop ,now at 106-108 Causewayside.Good quality  antique stripped furniture at reasonable prices and the owner is always willing to haggle!Delivery is free in Edinburgh too which I thought was marvellous.There seems to be new stock arriving daily,probably because it's so well priced it flies out of the door.There is bric-a-brac,paintings etc.but mainly furniture.I loved it and will return.
