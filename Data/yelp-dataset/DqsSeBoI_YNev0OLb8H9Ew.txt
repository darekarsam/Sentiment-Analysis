3	I could tell it was a Canadian McDonald's..............as it had Air Hockey in the kids play area!Gotta love it.They also had MX radio playing.A little Sade always adds to the devouring of a cheeseburger.
3	It's McDonald's... and a 3-stars rating is as high as any franchise fast food restaurant can get.The ambience is just GREAT. The place is very clean, and I really like how the place is decorated (with a fake fireplace and couches).More importantly, the service is really fast and friendly.
