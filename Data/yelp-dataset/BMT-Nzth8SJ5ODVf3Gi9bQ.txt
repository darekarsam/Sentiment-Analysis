5	After having bad experience at Cvs waited in line for 20 min just to drop off my prescription and than over 40 min to get it filled. I decided to go to All-Care pharmacy. There was no waiting in line and my All of my prescriptions were ready in less than 10 min Also they are very friendly and knowledgeable
5	I cannot commend this pharmacy enough. Excellent prices, service, selection. Raef is awesome! Shaya and the staff are great too. I've been more than impressed and pleased with this place and have transferred nearly all of my prescriptions here. No fuss and you're out of there in 20 minutes! You get the feeling right as you walk in that they genuinely care. I wont go any where else.
5	There are too many nice things to say about this group! I have never felt so welcome in a pharmacy before! The staff knows what they are talking about and are always great at answering my questions! They also always try to educate you on how you can save money! They are also the only pharmacy that has the drop I use for my contacts! So much better than going to Walgreens!
5	I love this Pharmacy!!!!!  After dealing with the big chain pharmacies for so long.....I was blown away at the customer service.  They always go the extra mile.  I get my RX from the manufacture of  my choice and mailed to my door.  Yeah
