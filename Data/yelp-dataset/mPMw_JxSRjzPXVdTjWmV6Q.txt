4	I finally got to try this place out. Rand had told me about it but you can't really know until you try for yourself. The help was friendly and so on.... when it comes to fast food two things decide 4 me Food vs. Price.The Burger I got was Juicy and wonderful I ordered a combo and it was like $8 and change. Not much else to report folks. =)

4	My favorite fast food burger joint. Never disappoints and at a reasonable price. It always gets packed around lunch time and seats are not always available.  Only thing that bothers me is that they charge extra for ranch when you buy onion rings. That's like charging extra for ice when you order a lemonade. It just goes together. Maybe they should charge after the second container of ranch but the first should be free. No worries, I found a perfect solution to that problem: Don't buy the dam onion rings, their loss. Just hate it when restaurants try to be sneaky about raising prices by adding them on to something else. One more thing, I could not figure out why my kids refused to eat here until one day I ordered a kids meal for my self and the burger was awful, just dry and gross. I would not want to eat that either so now we let them order a #1 from the adults menu.
