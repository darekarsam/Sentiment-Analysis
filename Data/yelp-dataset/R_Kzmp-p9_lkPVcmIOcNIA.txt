4	Parkings pretty easy as its in a strip mall area. The people are very professional and will show you homes within your preference and price rangeThey will also pick u up from whatever hotel or place you're staying  and drop you back  after showing you the homes.
5	I met Shane Nguyen with 1st priority realty through a friend Ryan.  From the moment I met and started chatting with him I got a good feeling.  Not only was he friendly but he was very professional and knowledgeable.  I felt confident that I could put my trust and faith in his capabilities.  As it turned out...I was right.  Shane found me the dream location for my business.  After which, he negotiated a fantastic price per square foot and length of lease was optimum.  His communication with the leasing agent was great, he showed to all appointments with me on time or early, and best of all he was always available to me whenever I contacted him.  Honestly, his customer service was top grade.  I highly reccomend him and have only praise for his abilities.  Thank you shane...
1	I contacted a woman named Na (Nga Diep) off of a MLS listing for a property. Upon reaching her, after several attempts, she was rude and short with me when I inquired about viewing the property. She told me that she couldn't show me the property because it was the New Year and that she would call me back after the Holiday to see the property. Surprise, no call back. When I contacted her again to see the property it was already off the market, surprisingly since she couldn't be bothered to show it. I am severely disgusted as the property was perfect for us. I will never use this company and strongly urge anyone dealing with them to avoid Na (Nga Diep).
