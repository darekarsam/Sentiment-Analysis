4	This place is in the office building next door to the preschool I work at. Very nice place, great dining area. lots of food choices. The only reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars is because it's a little bit on the pricey side. I had a Garden Salad and a Grape flavored G2 (Gatorade) for my lunch today, as it was my first time trying this place out and wanted something I knew I'd have the time to eat on my lunchbreak. The salad was really good and filling. I got my money's worth, that's for sure. I know I will return in the future, because the atmosphere is great, the dining area is very nice, and the workers there are friendly.
3	Im a regular here. Good food. Although the boom box blaring on the counter might explain the errors of omitted ingredients of my orders lately.
3	This place is located by our office. Overall the staff is friendly and the food is okay. I do think it is quite pricey for the quality of food but you pay for convenience. I do find it crazy they charge $.75 for a side of dipping sauce. Even if you order French fries or onion rings. The only thing free is ketchup and no one likes ketchup (hence that's why it is free).
