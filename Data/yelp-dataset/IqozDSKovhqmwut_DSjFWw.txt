4	This is where I make most of my sports bets. It's close to my house and there is plenty of seating. There's a bar right next to it too! There's also an elevator at the far side of the parking lot which is right next to Sports Book.
4	Located inside Aliante.  This sports book is conveniently located right next to the parking garage entrance.  I still think that this sports book is one of the best ones to watch the games and maybe place a bet a or two. There's usually enough seating and the lines are handled fairly quick here.  Dollar drinks and snacks during the games are bonus. It rarely gets busy here so it's not a bad place if you just wanted to relax to watch the game.  The bar and seating is plenty.
3	This review is for the sports book and specifically for the football season.  During game days, there are $2 beers and they have a good selection on domestic beers and Coronas.  The sliders ($3 for 1, $5 for 2) are a disappointment and I've tried them on 3 separate occasions.  The ciabatta bread doesn't seem to be the proper choice and the meat is dry and overcooked.  The condiments are excellent, which is why I keep on giving them another chance.  I wish they would simply return to the traditional hot dogs, but they are trying to distinguish themselves from Station properties.  There is a food court right next to the sports book and you can bring food from there. Additional positives are you don't need a reservation for a small television and you get a free drink ticket for a $20 bet.
