4	The kid in me jumped out and had to go in this canadian version of build-a bear. I made a red haired girl doll which i love. Very pricey once you begin dressing the doll or plush animal though. As a tourist, i liked the selection of canadian logo clothing for the dolls. Very friendly sales guy, no pressure to buy anything.
3	Adorable store - very similar concept to build a bear. My girls loved making their own stuffed toys. The sales person was very helpful. The only caveat was that I asked to be directed to the cheaper dolls for my girls to choose from, and realized later that there were even cheaper options that I wasn't shown but it was too late, my girls made their selections and I couldn't say no.
