1	They may accept pets but also accept smokers--the room smelled like a smoldering pile of  feces laced  vomit.  This place is disgusting--no black light needed to illuminate the extent of filth.
4	Cheapest hotel I could find in the Madison area.  Checking in and out was quick, employees were nice enough, the bed was comfy, the room was clean, and they even had a continental breakfast.  The air conditioning unit was pretty loud so I turned it off at night.  I also recommend bringing your own pillow.  Still, I've stayed at worse, and at $50 a night, the price is unbeatable.
