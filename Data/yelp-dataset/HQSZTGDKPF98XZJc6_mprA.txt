3	Great service, nice smiles, listened to hotel California three times. Food was tasty but portions were really small. But! Open Tuesday! So sorta worth a walk. Acab.
5	Super delicious, reasonably priced and great service. Definite must-have in the neighbourhood and for pho lovers
5	This place is the best. I love it here. Food is so amazing. Staff is so polite and friendly. Its a must try. I promise you will come back. Shrimp rolls with peanut sauce excellent. Deep fried rolls are excellent not greasy. Pho soup with beef and ask for veggies in it too. Excellent.
