5	Kari arranged a mortgage for myself and wife to purchase a house in Las Vegas. We closed on November 1, 2011.. The loan was processed and complete October 27th.  Kari was very attentive and stayed on top of everything. The mortgage went very smooth even though we were 2900 miles away.If I have the need for a mortgage in the future, I would not hesitate to hire her again. Very honest and trustworthy, believe me in Las Vegas you have to be careful who you hire..
5	We were referred to Kari and her team and we were not disappointed.  We were refinancing our house to take advantage of low rates, and were pretty sure of what we wanted.  Kari looked at our situation and found a different approach that we hadn't even thought of that made way more sense and will save us a huge amount over the long haul.  Kari's a thoughtful, thorough professional and I would recommend her to anyone.
5	When it was time to buy our next home, Kari went to work for us. VA loan....she knew the ins and outs. The property was on a well and septic, she handled it. I'm not sure how much more smooth she could have made the whole process. When it comes time to buy some rental property...guess when we are going? She always responded quickly and never left us in the dark as to where we were in the process.Thanks Kari.
