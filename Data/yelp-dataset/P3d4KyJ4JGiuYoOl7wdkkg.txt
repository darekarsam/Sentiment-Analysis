5	When it comes to quality construction and top notch customer service look no further!  It was really refreshing to find an owner that is passionate about his company and who really cares about his customers.  Sunset Gates installed an RV gate (weather proof, composite material) for us and a side yard gate to keep the dogs and kids out of the pool. Both gates have withstood the test of time and still look great after a number of years.  I welcomed the opportunity to recommend Sunset Gates to my neighbors and they have shared the same feedback after working with Shawn at Sunset Gates.  Like I said, if you are looking for a dependable, prompt, and friendly company...Sunset Gates is the best in the valley!
5	After getting an estimate from another company I called to get one from Sunset Gates. They immediately emailed me information on gates I said I was interested in with the price right by each picture. Then they scheduled a free estimate at my home.  Shawn took plenty of time to explain each step and the price with different options. When they came to install it I was really impressed with the workmanship of the project. I just love my Sunset Gate. Oh, and Sunset Gate's estimate came in at 1/2 the price of the other company. I highly recommend Sunset Gates.
5	Just had my gate to backyard replaced after twenty years.  Sean, at Sunset Gates, brought over material samples and pictures.  I made mt selections and felt I would end up with a beautiful fence. - I DID.  Not only a  great fence, but, excellent attention to detail and customer service.  I would recommend to anyone.
