5	I have been to many Barbershops, mens hair salons ect... but I decided to try THIS Great Clips because I was nearby. WOW!!! VERY PROFESSIONAL AND ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!! By far the BEST in the area!Ask for SUZETTE she is amazing and my hair looks unbelievable!
1	The Great Clips on the corner of Cotton and Greenway is the best in the area by far!!!
5	I've been going here for years.  Although there have been some great people here, I always seem to gravitate back to Melissa, who does a fantastic job and is always great to talk to.  It's never a long wait, especially if you have the app and make an online reservation (easiest thing in the world), and the price is right.  Thanks, Melissa!
4	Great haircut for not much cash!  Melissa is awesome. She cut my hairs just the way I wanted them cut!
