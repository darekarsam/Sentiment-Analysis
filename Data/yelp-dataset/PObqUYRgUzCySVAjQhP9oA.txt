5	Great atmosphere! I have been a client of Lisa's for years and she's amazing. She is especially good with color. Very friendly and personable. I love the look and feel of the salon as well.

I have never had a bad experience with my colors and cuts. Her convenient location and flexible hours lend perfectly to my hectic schedule. I would recommend Lisa in a heartbeat! Thank you Lisa for all you do. You're appreciated more than you know.
