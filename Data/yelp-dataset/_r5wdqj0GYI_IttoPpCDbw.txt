4	Bites is a really lovely place to stop by for a snack!It's a small sandwich takeaway selling a nice selection of fillings, including some deli options. There are also a good selection of juice and nibbles in the fridge, all at cheap prices (but good cheap, as Jonathan said). They had some really nice coconut slices and the sweet eats such as the cake slices were quite massive in size (but surprisingly well priced considering the portions). What strikes me most of all about Bites is how lovely the staff are! I dragged my feet into this wee shop on the hottest of days like week and felt like I was going to faint. A bottle of water and a cake given to me by the lovely owner sorted me right out. We had a chat about the weather and holidays. It's nice when you visit a shop where the owner is genuinely interested in your custom. He was very polite and, since I'd had a bit of a rough couple of weeks, his chatty manner was just the right tonic to put me in a better mood!Wonderful service and nice food, I'd definitely go back.

5	Qute some way down what must surely be the greatest street in the world, by location alone I'm probably a bit biased towards Bites, but nonetheless it's a great stop for good, honest food with just enough frills to make it more memorable than your average sarnie shop.A BLT, cake and a bottle of juice came to less than 4 notes on my visit, and such a feast can often cost you not far off double that in Edinburgh's more glamorous locales. Next time I'm down  this end, I'll definitely be back.
