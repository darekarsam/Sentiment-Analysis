3	"You know you are in Pittsburgh when you can watch a Steeler's game and guys stripping in the same bar."This place was a trip.  No one was here and it felt like I was in the middle of nowhere  (I had to walk up to a drive thru ATM...that happened)Bartender and Dancer were so nice.  Played pool for a bit and got cruised by some seriously creepy guys.  Despite the sentence previous we stayed because the staff were extremely friendly.  The drinks and the dancer are cash only so plan ahead.  Atmosphere was clean and fun and could imagine this place getting packed on the weekend.  Nice mix of sports and dancing realness.  Wish 'em luck
5	Love this bar! Everyone here treats each other like family. The bartenders are terrific and so sweet and fun to talk to.  Great atmosphere. Eddieoke on Thursdays is a blast! Always a good time to be had!
2	Though I've only been here once (and will not come back), I came in on a Friday night and there were about 4 other people in the bar. I got a total creep vibe and left after a drink. It seems that this place picks up later at night, but it really doesn't seem like my scene.
2	The smoke,  can't escape it in Pittsburgh. This bar was a little scary. Not the bartender or its patrons but the bar it's self was scary.
