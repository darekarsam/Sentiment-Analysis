5	Red's Barbershop is a good, old fashioned, barbershop.Prices are average.What *isn't* average is the quality of the haircuts/hairstyles at Red's.Keith is not only a friendly and likeable guy, but he is, by far, the best barber in the area.Every customer gets the royal treatment at Red's:  I've never seen anyone rushed out of the door.  Keith makes sure every patron is treated well. This shop is worth the drive!(Note:  Red's Barbershop is in the second bank of stores, behind the Subway, Red Wing shoe store, and QuikSpin Laundromat.)
4	Great customer service, very friendly. Gave me a clean cut, definitely knows what he is doing. Well worth the fifteen minute drive. I will be a repeat customer for sure.
5	I cannot stress enough how great this place is! I stopped in today and got the best haircut of my life.  Keith did a fantastic job and was pleasant and professional.  After my haircut, for the first time in my life I had a hot shave with a straight edge razor, and it made me feel like a million dollars.  You should absolutely go here to get your haircut.  Great staff and very reasonable prices!
1	I recently moved to the area and needed a cut for my son. When we got there it looked broke down and crappy. The reviews mentioned keith so decided to go in and ask until lady came out and had a convo with me outdoors. She said he no longer works there and left a while ago. So I went back to my car and asked hubby what we should do. We decided to just leave bc I didn't want to take any chances on my sons delicate sensitive hair. Oh by the way it's not called reds anymore. Pineville something .. It's called now.
