4	I really like this place! I only eat the vegetarian options, so I can't comment on most of the menu, but what I have tried has always been fresh, delicious and CHEAP. I've had the large vegetarian roll ($5), and the smaller avocado, sweet potato and tofu tempura (between $2 & $2.50 each). The place is tiny but the staff are very friendly, and if you eat there they provide complimentary tea. When I took some leftovers home they packed it up for me and also included a fresh container of soy sauce, extra wasabi and ginger. So nice!Note for vegans: If you order the vegetarian roll, ask for it without mayo.
