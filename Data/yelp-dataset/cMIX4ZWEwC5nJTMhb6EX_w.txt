4	Great technology and great dentist. The best thing: I never waited in the lobby for more than 5 minutes!
1	I will never come here again and I recommend that you don't either. Poor customer service noone is even here and we have been waiting for 30 minutes. Then someone comes in after us and they are seen before us? The lady at the front desk /the dentist clearly has an attitude problem and doesn't know what they are doing. I have had better service at the DMV in south phoenix!
1	Horrible dentist. Tried to upsell me on literally everything and told me I needed six fillings replaced (that had been done all within the last few years). Plus the facility itself was dirty. Gross!
