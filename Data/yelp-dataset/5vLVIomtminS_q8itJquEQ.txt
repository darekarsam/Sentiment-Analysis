2	If you ever thought it was impossible to wait too long in the drive-thru, while you are the ONLY person there.....drop in on this hole in the wall.  It is possible!
1	This is the Burger King that corporate forgot. The food is awful (which doesn't help because BK is generally nasty), service is slow, and the ice maker makes a weird slurping sound....like someones in there. This place has such a lousy reputation that the line around the half gas station McDonalds can be wrapped around twice and no one will wait at Burger King. King Nasty!
1	Either my English muffin sandwich sat under a hot lamp all morning OR Burger King's kitchen staff just decided to deep fry the whole damn thing.  If that's not enough, the sausage smelled of animal decay.Just awful.
1	UGH.Nasty restaurant with nasty food. I can thank BK for ruining my dining plans this past weekend. Sometimes when you have kids, you have to eat somewhere to appease them. I used to only go to BK if I was "stopped up" and needed a release. Well, that's still definitely the case after eating there Friday night since I made intimate friends with my commode both Saturday and Sunday.This place is filthy. The food is atrocious.The employees are miserable (one of the cooks....No. the ONE cook was dressed in street clothes-whatever happened to uniforms?).Your pal,Walter
3	I have to defend this local BK as it has gotten of a lot of bad reviews.(not saying they were not called for)But as of moving to Stallings and having this as the closest quick fast food they are not bad at all.We have gotten to know the crew, don't know if that helps, but everything is fresh, hot, and never a messed up order. The burger buns even look like the commercial and not squished!!Overall good experience, will return for sure.
