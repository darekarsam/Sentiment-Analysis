4	Nice selection of bourbon and whiskey for such a tiny point of sales.
3	Hit and miss. Some staff are really nice, others are super cranky and rude.  Selection is OK.  Makes me miss the LCBO in Ontario though, cheaper prices and way better choices.
1	The manager closed and locked the door in my face at 5:55pm when the store closes at 6pm. I knew exactly what I wanted and there were still people in the store shopping. I articulated I just wanted to grab a certain item and go straight to the checkout but he refused to let me make my purchase,  even though the store wasn't closed yet and other people were still shopping around.  He was rude and obnoxious and yelled at me in front of the other customers in the store. It was a very horrible and discriminatory experience.
