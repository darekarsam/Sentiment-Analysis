4	Until Harvey Nicks arrived on the scene in Edinburgh, there were few places in which one could buy bona fide designer labels - Jane Davidson's boutique on Thistle Street was one of those few places. Stocking labels like Diane Von Furstenburg (she of wrap dress fame) and Missoni, this small shop was a favourite haunt of rich, fashion conscious shoppers. It is testament to the loyalty of its customers and the quality of the stock and service that this place has survived. If further affirmation is needed that is place is rather good, Vogue have voted it one of their best boutique's 2010 - and if it's good enough for Vogue.... it's too expensive for me (I can but dream).

The clothing store recently won a fashion award recognising its redeeming boutique qualities, and it deserves this accolade for its commitment to fine designer sourcing.Quality designer garments come at a price, so don't expect to leave here weighed down by shopping bags if you're on any sort of normal salary, but you will probably depart the shop with one, really high quality piece, which is better than a ton of cheap goods that will last all of two seconds. Diane Von Furstenburg, Herve Leger, Red Valentino, Lulu Guinness and M Missoni drape their delightful features alongside a host of other labels. Last time I visited the shop, my eyes were hypnotised by a silver, sequined dress upstairs, crafted by an Australian designer, obviously to exist purely so that people who are poor at saving money, like me, could marvel at its beauty, then have their heart broken by the price tag.
