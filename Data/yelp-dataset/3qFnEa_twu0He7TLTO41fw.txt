5	Berthas new place is beautiful!  Her and her staff ate always friendly and helpful.   Love that she seems skin script, and even got a few free samples!
5	I found Bertha online and have been coming to her store ever since. It's so convenient knowing that she has what I need when I need it! The staff is so friendly and accommodating. I needed to return something and I had no problem with the exchange. Thank you for such great customer service!!
5	I love this place!  Ive been shopping here for 4 years and its grown and expanded a lot!  Bertha offers everything I need for my small waxing and eyelash studio.  She is always there and always helpful and talkative.  I also took the Eyelash Extension class here and  I really enjoyed it!  Thanks!
