5	My house was broken into and I needed my window replaced QUICKLY. This was not only the quickest place I found, but the least expensive as well. They were friendly and professional. And they returned my call! Sounds crazy-but a couple companies didn't even do that. I was very pleased with their service and work they did.
4	Not too shabby! We stopped in to get a mirror cut to fit a frame.  They were over half the price less than another glass and mirror company in the area. So of course we would try them out.  They are only open until noon Monday through Friday. We stopped in around 10am for immediate service.  We brought the frame into their store so he could measure exactly what we needed.  I think it took him all of about 5 minutes for the entire transaction.  It was quick and cheap! I'm not sure he liked my Yelp picture snapping but it was only a few.  I wouldn't hesitate to go back if i needed another job done.   Thanks!
5	Green Valley glass installed 3 broken windows...@ a fair price. They showed up on time and finished the work in a timely fashion. I would definitely hire them again.
