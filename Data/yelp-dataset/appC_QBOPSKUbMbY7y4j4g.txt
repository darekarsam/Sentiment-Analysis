3	They have some really cute clothes in this place. The prices are a pretty wide range so it fits a lot of budgets. I just wish the gals that work here were friendlier. The other reviewer must have worked with other people. I wish they had been working today!
1	A perfect example why this small store won't last.  I purchased a full priced item for a bday gift and missed the return date not only for a cash refund but they wouldn't even let me exchange it which I would have been fine or get a store credit.  I would have eventually spent more instead of never going back again.  Poor customer service is why I will spend my money at Nordstrom's etc.
1	I tried to EXCHANGE. a pair of earrings I received for Christmas. Before I could even get them out of the bag , I was told ALL jewelry sales are final. That was that . I had never even been in the store , so instead of seeing the possibility of gaining a new customer , they lost one. Granted they have the right to make their own exchange policy, it is just very rigid. I clearly will never step foot back in the store. If you do decide to shop here , be sure , if it a gift , you know the recipient is going to love it.
