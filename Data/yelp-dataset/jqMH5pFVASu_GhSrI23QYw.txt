2	4:25pm on a Monday.  Airport is pretty packed and there is one person trying to work the register and make coffee drinks...no chance.   Get the girl some help!
3	They are trying. Looks like Starbucks but little bit different. Coffee is great. I ordered a Venti late and was informed. "We are not Starbucks" well them make more of a difference!!! Same ol same ol...... Seating area great.
4	This is ok. Not a place I will frequent though. Its a great place to get some work done without being bothered.
