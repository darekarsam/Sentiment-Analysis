4	Pretty fast drive thru unless it's lunch hour like any other place. Employees are pleasant. Can't say anything about the dining inside as I've never been there lol
5	I don't always eat fast food but when I do crave Jack in the Box this is the place! this location has great customer service very patient with customers and always get my order right and when I asked for extra sauce they don't complain or give you a dirty look this Jack in a box knows what they're doing! I've gone to other Jack in the box and horrible service... Keep up the good work 35th Ave and Buckeye location! I don't care if I have to take a drive to go to the jack in the box lol.. can't comment the inside cuz never been in side...
2	Slow, slow, slow. I watched the monitor and they had 3 cars sitting in the drive-thru for over 18 minutes! People were just standing around inside. It took me over 17 minutes to receive my Sourdough Jack...not worth it. Also, there are more than a few meth-heads making their residence right outside and you have to walk through them to get inside. I'll never be back.
