1	We hired them for a party because they advertised "state of the art equipment" and "will work wonderfully at your event guaranteed".  Pictures turned out good but we had to wait a week to get them because not all of the equipment worked.  Turns out there really is no guarantee.  We got small refund but not as much as we thought was fair.  We also got a dose of bad attitude after it was over.
5	iCandy was a GREAT vendor! They made the photos into a great guest book which means so much to see all of our family and friends having so much fun. They needed no direction or help in setting up and the end at the end of the night they gave us a thumb drive and our guest book. On such a busy day it was nice not having to worry.
