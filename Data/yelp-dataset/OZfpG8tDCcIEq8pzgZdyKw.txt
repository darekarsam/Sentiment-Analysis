2	It wasn't a busy night at the neighborhood, but you could have been fooled by how long the food took.  While it did take a while everyone was extremely friendly.  The food did come out hot, at least mine did, the rest of the plates were plate-warmer hot.  Everyone in the table resented me for "holding back" the table since they staff pointed out they were waiting on my burger.Which hey works as a segway onto the burger.  Quesadilla Burger.  I knew that was a mistake but I did it anyways.  The patty was sorta flavorful.  The toppings were in the bland category.  Cheese went MIA.  And the tortilla were over-toasted and tasteless.A big blah overall, which is sad, since we've had a grand ole time and good food in past visits.
5	The 7 ounce house sirloin is the bomb! 'Nuff said.
