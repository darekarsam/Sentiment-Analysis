5	Same Quality that most other panda express' have. Line moves quickly and always get free samples if you want to try something new. Parking lot is a little crowded depending on what time you go. But thats everywhere.
5	I've never been so happy to go to one place  all the time but every time I go the food is warm and not old . The restrooms are always clean and the staff is very friendly
3	Usually the food here is good, but today our orders of fried rice and teriyaki chicken all had that nasty burned taste. Unfortunate.
4	this location always has a line but it moves so fast !!  the food is ALWAYS  OMG fresh  and delicious always SMOKING hot and smells like heaven! they have awesome specials and tons of emploies so they never run out of anything!I love panda and this is my new fav location!
