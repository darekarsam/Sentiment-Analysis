4	Nothing shrieks "date night" like a laid-back Sunday night at a local haunted house riddled with enthusiastic high school actors! And it was definitely a bargain. We purchased the dual Crypt and Asylum on Groupon. When we got there, they talked us into the additional $2 maze add-on, which we probably could have done without. Not too crowded, and just the right level of spooky. :)
5	Very fun, and VERY scary. We had a great time. Perfect for a group of friends on a cool October night! Loved it!
2	This haunted house is minimally staffed and just not exciting. We went last year too and thought this year might be better. For $25 or so per person we went trough all 3 attractions and were done in less than 15 minutes all together...The best actor was the girl who was asking if we wanted to stay with her in a room of doors. The girls in the toy room that asked of we wanted to play were good too. There just didn't seem to be anything going on here except the chainsaws at the end which were cool.
