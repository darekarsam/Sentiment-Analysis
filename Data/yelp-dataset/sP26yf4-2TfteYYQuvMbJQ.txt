5	Great little cafe on the first floor of the Forbes Pride Building at 1425 Forbes Ave. in Pittsburgh.  Serving delicious sandwiches, hot coffee, refreshing ice tea and tasty sweet treats. Friendly owner, nice addition to the building!
4	What a nicely hidden gem in the Hill district.  Stephanie and DeAnne are awesome, friendly, and engaging.  I am going to enjoy eating their food and drinking their fabulous coffee!  Stop by and try some of their fresh, local, made from scratch food.  You won't be sorry!
5	This is a great option for lunch across the street from UPMC Mercy. Everything is cooked fresh and they don't have a microwave! No zapped foods here! They were open to substitutions and I will come back when I'm at UPMC. It's on the first floor of an office building.
5	Excellent spot for lunch - worth a try! Fresh food made from scratch and great service from the staff. Breakfast choices, lunch sandwiches, salads, etc. I will definitely return for lunch when I am back in the area!
5	Great spot! The food is fresh and tasty, and the service is super friendly. Highly recommended!
