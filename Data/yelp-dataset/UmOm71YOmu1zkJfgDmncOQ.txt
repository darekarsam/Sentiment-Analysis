4	I ordered a takeaway from here via Just Eat and have to say it's quickly propelled it's way to being my favourite Indian in Edinburgh.Chicken within the curry was delightfully tender and had the correct meat/sauce ratio, bread arrived warm and not soggy and the rice was fine and fell apart when served.Top marks only avoided by the 1 hour wait for delivery but I can live with that!!
