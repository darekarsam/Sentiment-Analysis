3	I went for champagne afternoon tea with my husband.  it is a bit of a mixed review because The food was fantastic but the service wasn't good at all. From our table we could see the staff standing chatting up at the back of the restaurant.  When a waitress passed all four tables that were in needed something. I had to ask for fresh tea, additional plates, milk. I appreciate that it can be a hard balance to look after your customers without fussing too much but we were left to our own devices. At no point did anyone ask if we were ok?  Even when we left, not so much as an acknowledgement from the staff. There is potential here as the food was top notch but They need to pull up their socks on service.The place itself is fresh and bright and very comfy seating.  There was art work for sale on the wall and I was seriously tempted by a painting. Please see my attached pictures of our food.  The chef has done a great job putting the afternoon tea together. I am vegetarian and got a really delicious croissant with Mediterranean veg.  The little biscotti were the perfect crunch and the mini doughnut was delicious with the jam.  I agree with the previous review by Blythe that this place has potential but a little more work needed.
