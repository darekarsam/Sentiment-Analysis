5	Having a massage therapist come into the office at quarter end was amazing. Nothing better than getting a little relaxation to help get through an end of quarter push!
5	Awww yeah. Anne Marie gave me the most wonderful personalized massage yesterday, concentrating on my insanely tight shoulders. She played awesome native American chants and used some great oils that made my skin feel so smooth. I can't wait to see her again!
5	Anne Marie with AMRE Holistic Healing & Massage has wow-ed me from day one!! I am thrilled to have found her; especially during planning a wedding and moving a business where my body was needing a lot more work than usual. Her touch and combination of different techniques is top notch and truly one of a kind. I would totally recommend her to anyone needing deep work without feeling like it is deep tissue and still relaxing at the same time!!  I love that I can contact her pretty spur of the moment and she can get me in to see her pretty quickly! Thank you Anne Marie!! Looking forward to my next massage!!
