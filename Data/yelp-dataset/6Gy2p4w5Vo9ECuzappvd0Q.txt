2	Worst Port of Subs Ever! The meat was not even thick enough to make it from the slicer down to the sandwich. Then they threw on the toppings like it was a game of ultimate frisbee. Then they cut the sandwich on the wrapping tearing it prior to throwing it in a bag. By the time we arrived at our destination we had to try and piece together our sandwich so we could eat it. Just a lot of cost cutting that sacrificed the quality of the product. This area already has a severe lack of food options, I am sad that I cannot frequent this place in the future.
5	I think the secret ingredient in Port-of-Subs sandwiches is crack. Seriously. I crave it every day but I've forced myself to go only once a week.I don't understand the two star rating. This PoS is in a bad neighborhood, but is very clean and anytime I come in, the crowd is uniformed services workers (cops, firemen, mailmen, etc...) and the atmosphere is chill.When I go (which is usually lunch, I work Downtown) there is a fabulous server who is always in a great mood, but not so over the top that it's annoying. Everyone I've encountered who works here is in a pleasant mood and works very quickly.The best part about Port-of-Subs: unlike subway, their bread doesn't get stale while you're eating it. And you can get your sandwich grilled in a panini press, which I think is way better than toasting.
5	I love this store and the food. But the staff makes it worth the drive they remember what I'm going to order before I even open my mouth! It's always cleans there always polite the always get a nice tip they deserve the 5 stars they got from me keep up the good work!!! Thank you
