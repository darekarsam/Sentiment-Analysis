5	Super clean facility, great customer service. No fumbling for coins!
1	This place was not friendly. My dryer broke so I washed clothes at home and took them here to dry. I arrived at 10pm and their sign said they closed at 10:30pm so I thought I was good. All the doors were locked and when I finally got ahold of the lady working she just yelled at me that they were closed. I tried telling her I didn't need a wash but just to dry my clothes which would take 30 min. I tried to explain that my clothes would be done by the time they closed but she continued to yell at me from across the store that they were closed and shook her head. She didn't even bother to walk to the door to hear me out. She was very rude and I would hate to have had to deal with her if I came in earlier when she would have let me in. I recommend no one go here.
5	This is the cleanest laundry mat and good prices. About $1.00 a load. I will make this my home laundry mat for sure!!
