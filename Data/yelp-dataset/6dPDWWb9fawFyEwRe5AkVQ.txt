1	So today I took my Tahoe in for a detail here they did a decent job I checked my truck for anything of value before I left it due to having my jawbone Bluetooth,maglight and charger end up missing in the past all on different occasions today I knew I had $3 on the ashtray iPod connector and misc. coins. Three hours later I show up my truck looks ok after checking for the items I mention they are all gone!!! I can't believe these people I confront them about it but its like they don't care. They also wet my bass processor and is now useless this after they washed my carpet. I think this has done it for me no more Splash Car Wash worst place ever. Partially my fault for coming back after they stole from me the first time. Stay away!!
1	Car was not cleaned. They are more interested in the tips they don't earn. I watched the customers hand cash and drive off. More with some sort of guilt than with a clean car.
