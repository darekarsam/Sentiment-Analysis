1	Bad experience, cold food, brown lettuce, don't even know how to describe the tomato.  Don't expect gourmet but can I get decent?The girl in the drive-through would not stop laughing long enough to get my order correct, she got it wrong three times.  She then told me they did not make a drink that was posted large and clear right on the sign in front of my face with a price.  Won't be going back here.
1	I rarely eat fast food but hey, some times  a girl craves curly fries.This location has the absolute worst service: completely unable to get an order correct.  You would think they'd be able to find competent staff, being located across the street from a community college but apparently not.1. Ordered a munchie meal to split with my guy. Order placed fine, payment matched the order, got home to a chicken patty on a bun and curly fries all over the bag. No tacos to be found, not the sandwich we ordered, no container for the fries.2. Tried multiple times to order a smoothie. It's on their menu but they apparently just don't make them, or are unable to stock the correct materials. It's fast food, the ingredients are frozen, this shouldn't be that difficult.3. Drove by on my way to dinner plans, cars in drive-thru. Dining partner called to cancel, turned around to go in the drive-thru myself. Menu board on, no service. Dining room lights off. Closed early? Weird.Drove around the block and grabbed something else. Came back by, and what do you know? They're serving out the drive thru window again.I guess if you're only planning to really get the business of the community college, you can set your hours for whatever you like. But if you can't get an order right, you won't get repeat business. And if you can't adhere to your own hours, you won't get any additional business from the tons of residents in the area.Please put someone on drive thru duty who has active working brain cells.
