2	Aggressive prices, very nice support from Lee, John, Tammy and Joy -- BUT overall a bit disappointing.    I recommended them to our CEO and Sr. mgmt.  Collectively we were faced with Late pick-ups,  forgotten airport pick-ups, wrong vehicles for a long trip from Sky Harbor to Desert Ridge, cars with one head light out, no GPS...   Overall I've had better experiences with more reliable car services.  I would use them again but with caution.
1	Horrible!!!  I would send my least favorite person to them, but even then I think it is cruel and unusual punishment.  I would not use them to do anything but be a failure on every front.  If this review does not make your mind up...then I don't know what else to say.AVOID LIKE PARIS HILTON WITH THE PLAGUE!
5	I use CC regularly.... They are always there on time and easy to set up pick up and drop off times... They'll take u anywhere in the valley!! The drivers are always nice and dressed professional. One thing I've leave about living in AZ is that the no name cab drivers try to take advantage of u at ALL costs....
1	I have had an account with Continental Carriage for years, recently however, I must say they have been less than stellar. Recently, I scheduled a pick up and return for a party I was attending, the driver returned to the party, and asked me to come out to make arrangements for direct payment, I told him I was uncomfortable with this and he left, he then picked us up ( on time, I have to say) but when he brought us back, he demanded direct payment, he was very aggressive, and I felt threatened as he followed me up the sidewalk, I called the police.......this driver behaved like a thug........I cancelled my account.
