1	Be wary of any Tae Kwon Do place that makes you sign a contract. We did for our then 5 year old for 12 months. He liked it until the belt testing which was very intimidating. He has not wanted to return since. We made him go for awhile but he would cry and it got to be a miserable experience.  It has proven to be impossible to get out of the contract. There is no fee we can pay or anything. We are stuck paying $100/month for 6 more months for a service we don't use. Lesson learned, albeit an expensive one!
4	We signed my GF's 12 year old son up for this about 3 months ago and he has loved it. It makes us very happy since he's not very active of into other sports, this gives hims  way to develop discipline, respect, flexibility and take pride in earning belts. There are kids of all ages in these classes from 3 up. I read the review previous to this and can understand the frustration of not getting out of the contract, though they do have different contract levels and month to month. I don't think anyone likes contracts but that seems to be the norm as we did check out many places before going here. Master Kim and Willie have been great and we like the other little extra events they do as well. Over all we are happy.
