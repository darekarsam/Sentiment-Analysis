4	I really dig this neighborhood park. When I lived in Fourth Ward a few years back, this park was a welcome respite from the influx of concrete on Tryon St. With doggie water fountains, lovely flowers, the occasional yogi practicing in the park, small playground area and overall pretty greenspace this park is perfect in the fall & spring months. Whether you're walking your pooch, extending a jog or just looking for a place to snag some bench space and eat your lunch - Fourth Ward park is just grand.
4	Small but very nice oasis of green and tranquility a short walk from the downtown skyrises. Kind of a narrow park but surprisingly quiet in here given the proximity to downtown and there is a good variety of vegetation. Blends in quite well with the surrounding residential area. My one complaint is there are very few benches, perhaps the neighborhood residents don't want people hanging out too much or homeless people sleeping here..
5	I love everything about this park, even the ugly bird houses. It's difficult to say exactly where this park begins and ends. Yes, there is the obvious park with the green space, playground, fountains and little novelty art scattered about. But there's also the Fourth Ward houses and Uptown city scape framing the perimeter of the park. And to think not long ago this area was imfamous for its crime, crack houses and whore houses.
5	Came through the park proper on a Segway tour. Nerd alert!This park is right off of Poplar. If you're familiar with this street at all, you know it gets a little wonky near the neighborhood portion(s) of Fourth Ward. It's best if you just end up walking here rather than trying to find parking. Perfect place for walking your dog, a light game of catch, or just a small respite. There's a killer view of Uptown from the north side of the park, too.
