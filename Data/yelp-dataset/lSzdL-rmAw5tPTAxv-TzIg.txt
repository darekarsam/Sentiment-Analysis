5	A great place to eat great Italian traditional fare.  Service is always good and food is superior.  It's rare you see a great restaurant in a basement located a bit outside the hustle, but here is one of those cases.  When you come in you're treated to chicken wings before asking for anything: a great attention that is so appreciated, we always want more...Excellent place in competition with Le Latini, if I would compare them I would say both are great, but the Latini is better located, more modern and Le Piemontais is more authentic, friendlier and a bit less expensive.  Not a place to be seen but if you don't want a Desjardins manager sitting 10 feet from you and eat great traditional food in a restaurant 3 streets from the Complexe, it's the place to go.R.
4	Good italian restaurant in montreal. They offer lemon chicken wings which are really good. I also like the three different pasta plate. Good service...good place to eat!
5	After asking the staff from the hotel where I was staying at for a recommended restaurant, I tried this option and was certainly not disappointed!  The setting was very nice and inviting inside and the staff were very courteous 7 helpful.  I had their Chicken Tarragon which was lightly draped in a fabulous sauce.  As is the case with Italian fare, the sauce is everything and this meal delivered!Their wine selection has great variety and many wines to compliment their meals very nicely.After being impressed by their entree & wine, I was enticed to try their Creme Brulee dessert and it had some definite "Wow" factor!  I've had many Creme Brulees and this was one of the finest that I've had!
