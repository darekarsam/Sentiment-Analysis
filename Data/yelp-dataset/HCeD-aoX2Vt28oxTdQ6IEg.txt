1	I love Indian food, when I lived in toronto I lived and breathed Indian food. But this overpriced slop this restaurant tried to serve me was not Indian food. If you like loud music coupled with abysmal Indian food by all means go to Karma. However, if you any sense of what Indian food is supposed to taste like; Do yourself a favor and skip Karma, your taste buds will thank you.
4	This Indian restaurant which has a very upscale modern decor with lounge music and waitresses straight out of Robert Palmer's video "Simply Irresistable" has a limited but tasty menu for an Indian restaurant.
2	Me and my girlfriend went to this restaurant because we had a two for one coupon. I prefer my Indian restaurants the following way: they have a specific aroma, kitschy decor, cheap and tasty food and FULL of Indian people. Kinda like Chinese restaurants. Karma is the total oppositeThe restaurant looks like a supper club with the modern decor and loud music. The food was just alright but it was way overpriced for Indian food (portions were pretty big tho). Service was attentive but very slow.Bottom line: probably safe if you're an Indian food virgin but only go if you havea coupon or discount. I've had better
