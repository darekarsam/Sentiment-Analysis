5	I love using this UPS Store for printing projects at work.  The team is extra friendly and you can tell they take pride in their work, and in their customer service.  I always appreciate a business that is going to go the extra mile to exceed your expectations.  I have requested print projects with very short deadlines, and they are always happy to meet my needs, usually even faster than I could have hoped for!  Their prices are by far among the lowest for printing (trust me, I've used all the major print shops).  I would highly recommend using this UPS Store for printing/shipping services!
1	RUDE. Will not take prepaid USPS packages and letters although all the other UPS Stores do. On top of it, the lady was so stinking rude. Will go out of my way to avoid this shop. Caught a postal service worker on my way out and they graciously took my packages.

They are great about communicating to let me know when the prints are ready to be picked up or if there are any problems.  I'm not left wondering what's up with my projects as they communicate well.  Their prices are excellent too!  High quality all around.
