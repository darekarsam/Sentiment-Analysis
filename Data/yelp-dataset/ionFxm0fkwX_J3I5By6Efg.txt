1	I had to add this business to Yelp so I could trash it. I cannot tell you how many times I've been frustrated by this gas station. They NEVER have paper in the receipt machines, so you always have to walk inside for a receipt. This defeats the whole purpose of paying at the pump! It infuriates me and I've stopped going to this place except to use their ATM.Things aren't any better on the inside. The pop/slush machines often aren't working, and the pizza they advertise is stale and disgusting. And I'll be nice and withhold comment on the employees themselves.
3	Has what you need. Then again, I primarily go for coffee in the mornings while working across the street...it's a gas station, nothing more to day.
2	Wow...talk about a backwards shop.  The computer system is from the early80's and I had to use a phone to make a Western Union transfer. If there ever was a location that required updating, this would be the one. It doesn't even need to be updated to modern day, the late 90's would be fine as well.
2	Totally nondescript place to stop and get one item you may need.  It's a bit unsettling when you walk in here.  By that I mean it smells.  I'm not sure what the smell is, but it's not a good smell.Another thing that I cannot figure is why is there only four pumps at this gas station when it is on such a big lot on the South Side.  Smack dab in the middle of the other two gas stations that I'm aware of, each on an end of the South Side.  Weird.
