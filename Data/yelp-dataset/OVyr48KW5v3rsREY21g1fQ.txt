4	The specialty is desserts, which we didn't try. We went for lunch (because we had stopped at Fairmount Bagels around the corner to try Montreal bagels) , and had both tasty and healthy lunches. One of us had a "B.M.Z." ( no idea what it stands for:  delicious brown bread, avocados, cucumber, cream cheese), Kilo Burger and Pollo (chicken) burger. The sandwiches came with nice salad and nacho chips. We didn't try and deserts, but had a much healthier lunch than we get at most sandwich spot.s
3	While wondering the plateau, and looking for a random place to get some grub, we stumbled upon KG Cafe.  Looking at the store front, it was very inviting, colorful and industrial, having a garage door for the front window.  Inside, the industrial look continued with piping and electrical conduit running along the walls and ceiling.  There is a large seating area, which is not expected looking at the front of the business.  I suppose they are known for desserts and/or their massive candy selection, however, they have decent sandwiches.  I got the pollo burger, which has pesto, tomatoes, mozzarella and chicken.  The pesto is interesting, and I am not sure it is made out of basil.  My friend got the mexican panini, which he really liked.  The sandwiches are under $10, and if you want salad and chips it is an extra $2.50.  After dinner I had a piece of keylime pie which was just ok.  Service is good.  Would go back.
