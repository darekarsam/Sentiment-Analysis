5	I just switched from Cox to Century Link.  Cox had recently increased the cost for my 50 megabit plan to 73.99 per month.  I was able to get a 40 megabit plan for 36.75/month including the modem with my Direct TV subscription.Switching was smooth and easy.  My kids didn't notice it.I used an internet network speed test to measure the speeds of both Cox and CentruyLink.  With Cox, my peak download speed was 50 mb as advertised.  With CenturyLink the peak download speed is consistently about 35 mb for downloads (compared to the advertised 40 mb).  Ping times are longer with CenturyLink too (44 ms vs 11 ms for Cox).  Bottom line, CenturyLink is fast enough and the transition was painless.
1	Hands down, WORST service experience I have had in the last 5 years. The managers in the call center are inept,  with a total lack of knowledge of their own product. All that they want to do is argue with you. Had the pleasure of speaking with Jose today, and he did not know what modem I had...what modem they were offering..what service was available. Save yourself the trouble, time, and money and go with a service that has a true interest in quality and service. We will be looking elsewhere for a provider, as this one is JUST terrible. You would think that after 7 YEARS of being a loyal customer, I would at MINIMUM receive respect when I call in about troubleshooting issues and product quality issues. I would RUN from this company, as fast as you can.
