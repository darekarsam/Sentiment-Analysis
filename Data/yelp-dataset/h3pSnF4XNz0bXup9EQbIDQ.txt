3	It just goes to show how little I know about football - I was in here recently, and while I picked up on the football theme, I had no idea of the Hibs connection and the fact the stadium was just down the road.Aaaanyway, the pub itself is actually quite cool - its a bit old man pub-esque, but the staff are friendly, the atmosphere iswelcoming and even when there is a big bunch of rowdy football supporters in the pub the whole place still feels quite fun and relaxing.Drinks are cheaper than you may have expected, but service can get a bit slow and sloppy, but other than that, an alright place for a pre-match drink. As long as you support Hibs.
