3	As I waited in line to have my ID checked, I used to wonder why are people getting coffee OUTSIDE security? They can't bring the liquids with them into the secure area of the airport. It made no sense.Tonight, I was meeting a friend at the airport and the answer to my question was realized. There is NOTHING outside of security. If you're waiting on a delayed friend to arrive and you don't have a boarding pass, then for you this is the only food at the airport!This location has the usual Starbucks selections of coffee beverages, water, baked goods and pre-made sandwiches. There is no place nearby to sit, but if you do find a seat, enjoy CLT's free Wi-Fi.Warning! This is not a "Starbucks" operated location. The employees here work for HMS Host. With that disclaimer out of the way, the barista who prepared my latte did a good job, especially considering that she was running the stand on her own. She was friendly and had a big smile. I left a dollar on the counter - there was no tip jar.
