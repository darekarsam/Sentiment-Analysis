4	Employees a few years ago were wonderful, friendly.  Staff has changed and the new manager was extremely rude.  Went back a few weeks ago and seems like things have turned around (thank goodness this is very close to my house).  Managers are wonderful and the staff great now.
3	I went there a few times. I decided not to return when the staff gave me the wrong order, which I noticed when I arrived at home and had to drive all the way back to get my correct order. They just gave me the right order. I would have expected at least a free drink or dessert or something... Can't beat Li's Bowl.
5	Dan helped us there.  My office goes there all the time for lunch and they are always speedy, accurate and friendly.  They seemed to be trained consistantly and always offer an egg roll and medium drink.  The entrees are always warm and seem fresh.
4	Good clean location. Food was freshly cooked when I went for lunch. Friendly staff, no complaints. I'll be going back to this one. :)
1	If I could give them no stars I would. I have had repeated problems every time I go here. I am DONE!!!!  Everything from slow service to cold food wrong orders and RUDE employees. I have tried to call to let upper level management know and nobody seems to care because it never gets better. So I am taking my business to Li's Bowl on 35th and southern. Great food that's FRESH and nice employees. See ya Panda anything but Express.
2	we went through drive thru on 11-9-14 around 6:30 pm.  we ordered our usual entrees.  the service was a little slow but nothing to freak out over.  we get home and noticed that our 2 combo meals are messed up.  we just ate what they gave us.  my biggest complaint is the half and half of brown rice and chow main.  both were dried out and had no taste.  the food overall was horrible.  i will not be going to this location again.
