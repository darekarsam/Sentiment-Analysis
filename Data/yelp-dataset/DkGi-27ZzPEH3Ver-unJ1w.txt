4	I like: How they change up their menu on a regular basis, offer tapas, have a big terrace, and have the occasional show. The food is fresh and tasty & the location is nice (Urban but not too crowded and close enough to the metro).I dislike: The "meh" service (Both times I visited I've had some sort of minor service issue here). They seem to be rather unorganised, which is a shame.
4	My wife and I went to this place and we both liked it.  It has a stage for live music both there was none when we went (wed evening).  The service was a little slow but we were not in a rush.  The waitress apologized for the slow service which I thought was a least nice of her to acknowledge the issue.  We had coffee, tea and dessert which was good.Overall I would say I would go back again since we liked the spot and atmosphere.
