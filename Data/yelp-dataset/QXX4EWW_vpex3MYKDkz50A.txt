5	Been going here for years. They have worked on all the vehicles in my family and they will always be the ones I go to! They have never run up a bill and this isn't the place where you go in for brakes and they tell you you need a new engine. Prices are maybe a bit more than other places but they are definitely fair and peace of mind is worth it knowing they aren't throwing parts at you.
