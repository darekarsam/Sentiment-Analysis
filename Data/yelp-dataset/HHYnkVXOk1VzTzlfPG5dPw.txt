2	My ten year old son loved it. Need I say more-it was more about quantity then quality.Right next to Guitar Center  and Bonefish-either one I recommend- but don't stop for salad next door and expect much.
2	Sounds health conscious, and it probably is the smartest choice for a buffet.  It is still a buffet nonetheless.  Both times that I came here to eat I ended up with a mountain of junk on top of my lettuce by the end of the buffet line.  I noticed that the food isn't always replaced either, especially when they aren't crowded.  It is no secret that gluttony is the most American deadly sin, and you would think salad gluttony would take a bit of the guilt off, not so much.  I still left feeling bloated and ready for a nap after my meal.  If you want to do a buffet, do it right and quit kidding yourself with this soup and salad nonsense.
3	OK....so it's a bona fide feed trough.  Better to bring your avarice and appetite here, and get a few veggies.
3	It's a $7 buffet so what are we expecting here, people!?  I think for the price, it's a decent meal.  There is every type of lettuce, topping and dressing you could hope for on a salad.  And I loooove a big, juicy salad!  In addition to the greens, you can find pizza, garlic bread (which is actually really good), baked potatoes which you can top with bacon, cheese, sour cream, etc.  There are 4 soups to choose from, a mini taco bar, and basic desserts (pudding, angel food cake with strawberries, ice cream stand).  There are also several pasta salads.Everything is replaced ASAP.  Could it be better quality with more choices?  Absolutely.  However, I like the fact that it's cheap and there is enough variety for a quick meal!
