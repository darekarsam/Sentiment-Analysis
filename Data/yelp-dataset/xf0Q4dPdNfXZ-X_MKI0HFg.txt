3	Going back 17 years this building was my introduction to 24 hr Mexican restaurants in Arizona.  My sister, the frugal one, recommended this place because you could get a chimichanga for $3.50, split it, bring your own water and have a budget dinner night out.  Her husband is still skinny.:-)  The building was originally a Taco Bell and I think maybe a Filberto's along the way.  Currently it is undergoing a repaint and a new facade.I got my normal #5 (beef taco, cheese enchilada with rice and beans, $5.79) and a small Horchata ($1.39).  The food was as I expected, filling, ok taste.  What I have come to expect. The restaurant was clean and the staff friendly
2	Just OK!!! Had ALOT BETTER!!!  But I guess the price and open 24hrs. Helps this place stay in bussiness!!! I must say waitress was good and served fast!!!
4	How can you beat tacos for $1.25 and burritos for $2.50 Monday thru Wednesday. The tacos that I get are the shredded beef along with the shredded beef burrito or a green chili burro. The small street tacos are pretty good also and there is a special 5 for $5,99. I love the breakfast burritos here,  generally get the country burrito with potatoes or the the chorizo burrito which is my favorite but unfortunately my stomach doesn't do well.If you want inexpensive quick good Mexican  food you can't beat the price.Is there better Mexican food that this probably but for something quick to you can't beat the price.Will keep coming here again and again.
