5	I just went to their Nutcracker event in central Phoenix last weekend after being invited by some friends. The auditorium was packed, but I felt like more people should know or be going to something as creative as this.  I haven't taken a class here yet, but seeing the students perform through hip hop dance the Nutcracker story was incredible. I seen all different types of people, ages, shapes and sizes in the dance groups that are students of Jukebox so I feel like it would be a great place to learn some dance. My girl and I were talking about possibly doing a hip hop class there so if/when that happens, I'll update the review to let you know about that. I did stop into the studio to buy the tickets, it has a nice urban feel to it, even being in the middle of Gilbert in a strip mall. They had great artwork and paintings on the wall, and one of the instructors was quick to tell me that the place still had a few things to fix  since they are not done fixing things up. So give this local business a shot and take some classes there!
1	OK so I guess I will Google this place as the website here is a bogus one that takes you to some singles site. I was interested in finding a studio that offered adult dance lessons/classes, this came up and no legit info.
4	The studio is really new and awesome. Lots of new fresh instructors who do great warm-ups, exercising , and cool downs. The classes were well priced and they played great music!
