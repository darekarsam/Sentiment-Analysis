4	Great service, good prices. They check everything so that is always a plus. Make sure you make an appointment because they are always very busy.
1	You know, it's pretty ignorant for the shop manager (travis, Tyler, whatever his name is) to argue with a potential customer when they call, looking for some work done.I need a transmission cooler installed and he wants to argue that I don't need one and he has no idea about the vehicle I am inquiring about. It's a well known fact that the particular Army vehicle that I won needs one, if I am going to be towing anything substantial. Also, he has no idea how the internal to the radiator cooler performs that is already present (stock) and that it is pretty inefficient,as  a cooler. But he doesn't want to listen and wants to debate it. Idiot. My money will spend just as well, at another shop. Way to go bro!
1	Run for the life of your car from this place! They took an hour or more to do a simple diagnoses and gave my warranty company the runaround! The manager Tyler is full of himself. They are slow and basically I ended up taking my vehicle elsewhere! The hours it took for a diagnosis I listened to him argue with potential customers, turn customers away before looking at their vehicle, and try and tell me about his sad love life! Do not go here ever!
