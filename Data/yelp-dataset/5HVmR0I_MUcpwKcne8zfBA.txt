4	I went to Desert Valley to get an Upper GI screen. I got lost on the way (dang google maps), I called and the receptionist gave me great directions. The test itself is pretty gross, you have to drink Barium and roll around like a guinea pig while they xray your stomach. The nurse and the xray tech were both really nice and friendly and explained everything along the way. If you find yourself in a situation where you have to get a GI screen, I would recommend Desert Valley. The staff was polite and professional and made me an uncomfortable experience almost pleasant.
1	My boyfriend was in extreme pain and the customer service was atrocious. The front desk women had passive aggressive attitudes and not only did we wait an hour and a half because they messed up his insurance billing but he missed his doctors appointment. Plus they didn't even give him his paperwork to fill out until we called the doctors ourselves to get the correct information which took half the time it did for them. Very unorganized and not recommended if you have any other plans for the day or want to be heard.
4	I went in for a simple Ultrasound (to see if I'm pregnant) lol.  I got there about 15min early to fill out paperwork (as directed).  After I turned in my paperwork I was immediately called in.  The procedure was quick - I was complimented in that I was a perfect specimen for training/school because I "show well".  Sweet!  I was told 48 hour turnaround for the read and delivery to my doctor.  I got my shirt back on and walked straight out the door.
