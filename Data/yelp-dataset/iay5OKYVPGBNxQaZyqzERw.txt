5	next to the fwy !! great staff and friendly!! no wait !!!
1	I wish there was a "no star" option! This was absolutely the worst customer service experience!I was the only person in line while 2 tellers were assisting others and two other tellers left for break as I waited while a teller listened to someone tell their life story without knowing how to move the person along. As I waited in line 3 more people joined me while we listened to this guy's story and watched the teller and waited, waited and waited.The teller did thank me for my patience but only after I asked the manager if another teller could assist and then charged me $5 for not having an account!I wonder if they ever heard of social media and reviews like this!ABSOLUTELY THE WORST CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE!
