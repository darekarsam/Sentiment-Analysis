1	Worst McDonalds!!! they took 45 min for one burger BULLSHIT!!! someone needs fired!
3	I've never had bad drive-thru service here and their food is sometimes all you need. Like when I'm hungry, and Darren isn't around, and I don't feel like cooking. lol.
1	Seriously the worst McDonalds I've ever been to. Service is always slow. I'm currently sitting in the parking lot right now with about 4 other cars from the drive thru that are waiting for food. If I could read my receipt (printer must be low on ink), I'd call the corporate office and tell them to fire the whole place and start over.
2	This isn't the worst McDonalds in town, at least they eventually get your order correct. But the situation inside is fairly ridiculous.  The crew during the day seems to be over a dozen employees, but they only ever have one person taking orders, and you have to wait on that person to wander back to their post to actual sell you some food.  You can see half a dozen employees in the back apparently working on cooking food, but all those people still can't get your food out in less than 10 minutes. But while you are waiting you can watching another half dozen employees at the take-out window chatting the day away while one person occasionally fills up a bag and gets an order out.
