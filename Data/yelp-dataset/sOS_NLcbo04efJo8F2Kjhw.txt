5	I'm a sucker for Starbucks. I am one of those people who will gladly pay $12 for one coffee if it tastes like heaven. And at Starbucks, I'm never disappointed!
4	Loved the drive-thru here when I was living in Laval. Fast service, great for collecting rewards stars. Never sat outside on the patio but definitely some vehicle noise. Inside had lots of seating but arrive before 6 pm if you want a seat with an electrical outlet. It's full until 11pm.
5	I am a sucker for Starbucks so thats why I give them 5 stars. This location has by far the best service and staff ever. Fast service and they are very friendly.It is a little expensive and I wouldn't come by everyday but it is a great place for a treat in a warm sunny day
