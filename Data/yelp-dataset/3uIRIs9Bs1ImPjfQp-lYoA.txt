4	If you want a somewhat touristy "typical German" experience, Lehner's is the place. Dark wood, heavy benches, multilingual waitstaff dressed in lederhosen or dirndls, plenty of beer choices and a kid's menu -- the whole nine yards. Food is super-German, in that it's meat and stodge and gravy and pretty darn good. Not the world's cheapest place, but hardly bank-breaking either. Can get quite loud later in the evenings. In nice weather, the outside seating is excellent for people-watching, as it's in a high-pedestrian-traffic square.
4	Very nice atmosphere. Great sausages and good choice for a variety of German food. Prices are very reasonable. English menus available.  Nice outside seating area.
5	Essen Super,Bedienung Super nett, hat immer nach dem Rechten geschaut, flott aber nicht aufdringlich.Preise im normalen Rahmen.Auf jeden Fall empfehlenswert!
3	The old building itself is very interesting and the restaurant/ bar is located within e entrance area of the theatre.Considering high ceiling, the location is very loud.The food is good and reasonably priced.Therefore a reasonable location but lacks to fulfill the expectation of being located within an great old building/ theatre...
