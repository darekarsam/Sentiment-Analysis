5	Oh wow, this guy is a true artist.   My uncle brought me in here to get "the best smoked salmon ever."  He was so right.  We got a sample while we were there, and we were hooked.  Came home and three of us ate half of our 1 1/2 pounds we ordered.  And now that I'm talking about it, I want to go eat the other half!
1	Buyer beware! I recently bought 1/2 pound smokes salmon. The counter is set up so you cannot see them slicing the fish. I must have received the last pieces because when he was done he threw out the carcass. When I opened my package at home the pieces were hard and dried out. I returned the next day and explained what happened to Frank, the owner, requesting a replacement.  In an unpleasant tone he told me, too bad, someone has to get the end pieces. These are not honest people and they don't care about their customers.
5	I'd recommend this fish store if you are buying a whole salmon to poach:http://jitterycook.com/2011/11/29/poached-salmon-salad-sandwich-with-sauce-verte/or for their amazing smoked salmon that I've featured many times at www.jitterycook.comThey do have the best smoked salmon imaginable. Silky smooth. And you are offered a sample as you wait your turn in line.
5	The best fish in the city!!!!  Amazing tuna, delish served seared or tartare!  Salmon by the slice or buy the whole fish, prepared exactly the way you'd like.  Halibut, trout, peppered salmon, tilapia, red snapper, stripped bass, and more!  Of course, THE WORLD'S BEST SMOKED SALMON!!!!!Service is incredible!!!!  Frank and the boys always make you laugh and if you're lucky...they'll share a story with you :)Cheers!!!
