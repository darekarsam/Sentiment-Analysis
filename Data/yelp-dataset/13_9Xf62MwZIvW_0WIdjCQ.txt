3	Holy Family Catholic Church is a church with a large older population and a large Hispanic population.  It isn't as affluent as St. Viator's or as vibrant as St. Thomas More.  But I prefer Holy Family because of the schedule for the Adoration, the friendliness of the community, and the appealing homilies by Father Gene.  My 12 year old and 8 year old actually ask to go to Mass and are up and ready for the 8am Mass by 6:45am because they like listening to Father Gene.  Not having to fight to get them into church is enough of a recommendation for me.
3	The Holy Family is the closest catholic church to my place which makes it very convenient for me. I've gone here a few times in the past few years, even before I moved to Vegas, because my aunt took us to mass here and I notice the parish has made some changes. But I come because the community is friendly and Father Gene delivers interesting, easy to understand, and meaningful homilies. He has a nice sense of humor as well. The noon choir is more like a band and is very upbeat and loud, which I don't mind because I'm there for the mass and message. The band is the young adult group and play/sing well. However I do prefer the traditional and mellow music which the younger and older choir sing at 8am and 5pm mass. What ever mass time you attend, parking should never be an issue because there's a big lot with plenty of spaces. I also like it because it's a nice church nestled in a neighborhood that isn't busy to get to.
