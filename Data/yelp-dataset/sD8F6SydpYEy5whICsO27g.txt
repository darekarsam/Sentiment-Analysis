5	Tiny little Polish piece of heaven in Jean Talon market. They have a sign which reads "Les Meilleures Beignes au Monde" by which they mean, quite literally "The Best Donuts in The World." Point finale. 6 donuts, 3 cream, 3 apricot please, and thank you. Light, puffy, buttery, icing sugar coated and just the right size. They are not fracking around. Tucked around the corner of their stall inside the market you'll find a small stack of fresh homemade rye bread - sesame seed! pumpkin seed rye! Toasted lightly with some butter and cheese: to. die. for.
4	ah, those ponki! self-proclaimed as best donuts in the world. i'd say best no fancy donuts in town (can't say in the world), just your regular lovely filled donuts.light, fluffy, a bit of a bite, not too sweet and filled with plum or apricot jam. they are that good? well yes, there's even a running joke out there that if one buys a box of 6 to take home, that box would be empty by the time one gets home.besides donuts, their rum baba are quite good too. light and boozy, the way to my heart! its a joke..not a fan of their other offerings. its not as good or its way too sweet or quite underwhelming like the apricot ponki.and its only $5 for a box of 6
