1	It's a good Wendy's but not a good neighborhood! They do get the food order right, though the receipt is usually not included.Be VERY careful at this Wendy's and be especially aware of your surroundings. I have heard about at least one robbery and two car break-ins. Keep your wits about you as you're waiting in the drive-thru.I go, but only because it is very close to my home and it is convenient.
2	Not the safest one in the world, had a guy walk up on me for some money. People just standing around not going any where never a great sign. And they always forget your straw.
3	I was looking for a quick bite and stopped in today hoping for their flatbread and was super disappointed that they no longer have them! Oh well, stick to my good ol' standby...chicken nuggets and fries!  I arrived a little before the lunch rush, both my fresh fries and chicken nuggets were hot...as it just prepared!!! Oh yeah!!! Service was fast and the cashier was friendly. That's it! Short and sweet. I'll be back to this location, but based on the previous reviews I'll make sure to never go at night!
