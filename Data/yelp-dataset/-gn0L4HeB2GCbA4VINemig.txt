5	Just did a gut and remodel on my new home and this place was a lifesaver! This is a place where you can buy a whole slab. The pricing is unbelievably cheaper than buying the tiles or buying retail.As far as selection, wow, you have never seen this much granite in your life.Here's another tip, the sinks and fixtures are better than Home Depot or Lowe's and they are half - 75% of the price.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
5	Great crew! Always friendly and happy! Everyone there just wants you to feel comfortable and don't overwhelm you to buy buy buy! Even the owner will offer you something to drink... That's cool.  As a contractor I have been to every granite store out there and Aracruz is by far my favorite and well worth the drive. The also have the best pricing available. And a huge indoor showroom you can actually walk around, touch/feel the granite. Everything is well kept And safely placed. Andy and Ivan are great guys to go see but everyone there is great ! And will help you out.
5	I didn't end up buying a slab at Aracruz, but I can tell you that every time I went there, all of the sales people were extremely courteous and helpful.  I bought 3 sinks there for our bathrooms that were their brand, and I really like them because they are smaller than all the ones you see at every where else.  I have two small bathrooms and I wanted to preserve as much counter space as possible.  I also bought a stainless steel sink there for our kitchen, and I am not disappointed in the quality or the prices I paid.
