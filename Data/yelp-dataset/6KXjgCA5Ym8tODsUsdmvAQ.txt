5	i can't believe there are no reviews! stay central holds true to its name. 10 min walk to pretty much everything you need to see  (except for new town). a perfect location and very modern. has a very friendly staff and atmosphere.the running club they do on wednesday was great (although it was myself and the trainer). very pretty run around St. Arthurs seat. the pub attached gets pretty crowded weekend nights which makes for a fun time.
