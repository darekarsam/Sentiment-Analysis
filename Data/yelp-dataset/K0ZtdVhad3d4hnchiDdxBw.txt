1	We just got a couple cherry dipped ice cream cones and they were almost white we thought they just didn't dip them good enough because most of the employees don't, but this time it was like eating wax. This Dairy Queen is BAD and even the stuff the managers make are terrible. Find a better location or place to go!!
1	Service is NO good here. The kids that work here were arguing as we waited in the drive for our sundae's. As the girl handed us each desert, she didn't even make eye contact. Gave us two different totals AND messed up the order. My chocolate dip had a napkin stuck onto the dried chocolate... I will not go back to this location.
4	Considering the lack of fast food along this stretch of road, this place is open! I have had both good and bad here. I always get the chicken strips. It really depends on the time of day as to if they are fresh and hot. 1030 am, they are fresh! I have never witnessed kids working the drive thru, always mature adults. I am sorry previous Yelpers have not had a good experience, but it has not been bad the last 5 or so times I have been here. I will continue to come back! I did not give a 5 star because sometimes my chicken is not always hot and fresh, but still good.
2	New management but same poor training and employee attitude.  Cold food and when asked the employee if the wrap was supposed to be cold.  She said it wasn't because she made it herself in the microwave.  I said you better check the microwave and she gave me more attitude.  Don't expect much here!!!!
