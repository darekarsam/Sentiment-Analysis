4	Great Variety of chocolates
4	I had the pleasure of stopping into Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory while on vacation in North Carolina this spring. The variety of chocolates and dipped apples was quite large for the relatively small size of the store. I purchased a couple different things and they were all extremely delicious! I really enjoyed the English Toffee.The only negative was that the woman who helped me followed my every step and did not take her eyes off me a single time while in the store so it was hard for me to concentrate/make a decision on what I wanted to purchase. Maybe that's just a North Carolina customer service thing, I don't know.
4	The smell of places like Rocky Mountain, always make my eyes roll back into my head and my mouth forms a slight druel that I need to slurp back in.I can't really say that Rocky Mountain is any more special than any other chocolatiers you can go to, but it's still great.  The service was helpful and friendly and the prices were reasonable.  The chocolate and fudge?  Pretty darn great!Try:  Something you love covered in chocolate (I like the covered oreos)Avoid:  That gigantic peanut butter cup you've been eyeing.  Unless you're sharing with at least four people.  You've been warned.
