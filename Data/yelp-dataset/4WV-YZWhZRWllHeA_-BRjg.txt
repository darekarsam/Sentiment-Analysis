4	There are 4 Catholic Churches within 5 miles of my house. They all have staggered services to I usually attend which ever mass fits my schedule across any of them.  St. Vincent's however, is my favorite of them all.It is more casual and the people are extremely friendly. I most often attend their 5pm Sunday evening service which many of the other Churches do not offer.
4	My husband and I have searched for the right feel of the church.  We found that St. Vincent de Paul's had what we needed, a church that plays traditional hymns and we enjoyed the people and the community that the church offers.The other churches we have found were either too contemporary, or the songs did not go by the book that was in the pews (which made it hard for me to follow along).   After a month of being a regular, we decided to become parishioners.  We like the 11:30am mass.  We also like read more " the 5pm mass, as the guitarist plays and sings the traditional hymns are played :)
4	Guess this will be my second church review... if it doesn't get finished, I may have been struck by lightning... but I only have good things to say about St Vincent's!  I've attended one wedding, a baptism, and numerous Sunday Masses here and all have been very good experiences.  The church has a good size number to it, it's not too big and not too small.It's convenient to Park Rd - Pineville/Dilworth/SouthEnd area.  I don't go here as a regular, since I'm on the other side of town.  Plenty of parking and everyone is very friendly.  The building setup is pretty traditional with a bit of modern flair so it is really appealing to all generations.  Some churches are very one way or another, but St. Vincents seems to do a good job in attracting a wide variety of people - no matter what part of life you are at.If you have small children, there is a cry room and there are also a number of mass times to fit your schedule on the weekends.
