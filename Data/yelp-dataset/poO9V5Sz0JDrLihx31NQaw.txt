5	I love this store,I found my kind of clothes there .I am tall and getting older so this store is not just for 20 year old ones.And the prices are good.The store was clean and so where the dressing rooms. I can't wait to go back there.I could spend hundreds of Dollars there.
4	Very nice, yet crowded Kohls. I don't like that they have so many things in the center aisles. Makes it hard to shop especially during the holidays. The only place to get my husbands pants.Has some really cute kids clothes.
5	I've shopped at a Kohl's store in several different cities and states and they all seem to be similar and that a positive thing.  The merchandise is good for the prices, the salespeople have always been helpful and friendly and courteous, the return/exchange policies are excellent, and the discounts and specials and sales are frequent and valuable.  I buy much of my casual clothing there and find the selection quite accommodating.  If you don't find something, you can use their customer service phone and usually have the item delivered, free shipping.  I enjoy shopping at Kohl's and, to date, have never had a bad experience in any of the stores.
5	Whenever they have a sale is the best price ever in town for some middle level brands.Can buy a whole bunch of $3, 5 clothes.Has some unique brands which other stores dont have like Simply Vera Wang.
