3	Every once in awhile, after work or life has been stressing you out, you've just got to scratch the itch with fast junk food.This place fit the bill for me tonight.I ate the Western Bacon Cheeseburger.  It wasn't anything special but it was reasonably priced and they made it quick.The BBQ sauce was unfortunately bland, but that's probably so it appeals more to the masses.I now have a hamburger shaped lump in my stomach....and as after any act of mindless passion, I regret my actions.  :)

The "slice" of iceburg lettuce also lacked condiment. There was a slight dab of what may have been a sauce further up at the level where I was to find the saddest excuse for what came out of our oceans. It was gooey, brownish, and glued to the top bun which was otherwise toasted and dry. I really cannot express the level if disappointment I experienced today for lunch. To do so would make you cry and wish to toss yourself in front of a bus and end it all. Terrible lunch today.
