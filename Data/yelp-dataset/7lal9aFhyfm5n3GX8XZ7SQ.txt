5	My wife and I visited this restaurant this past weekend while in town for a short vacation and the food absolutely blew us away.  It was one of the best meals we've ever had.  Great presentation, the atmosphere was great, and the waiter was very helpful.  We would highly recommend trying this place out.
4	For our first dinner in Montreal, a friend selected Carte Blanche based on some excellent reviews on other sites.  It's a quiet. beautifully designed contemporary restaurant, a bit out of the way, but well worth a short walk.  Either of the two price fixe options, at $25 and $35 are great deal, and since we were a group of eight, we sampled just about all the items on both of them. There is a small, but well-selected wine list.We were pleased with the inventive cuisine, although more detail on the menu may have led us  to make other choices.   For example, the vegetable soup was pureed and served cold, not at all what we were expecting on a dreary, rainy night.  I also enjoyed my veal ravioli topped with foie gras but if I had known that they were served in a broth, I might not have ordered both  soups.   Overall, though, we were pleased with Carte Blanche, and would be happy to come back again.
5	The chefs tasting menu was a real treat. Getting to try unique dishes like the scallop civeche are so much fun. The space is cozy and staff was very attentive. All combined for a great evening
