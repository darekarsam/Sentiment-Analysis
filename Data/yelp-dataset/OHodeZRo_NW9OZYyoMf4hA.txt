4	Franchised out of the west coast, the local store is owned by cute and super nice couple Cecily & Shannon (he's a he).  Fantastic selection of semi-custom bridesmaid dresses available in dozens of styles, fabrics, colors.  Also, the PERFECT place if you need a somewhat conservative Black Tie dress for work, weddings, etc.  You won't see anyone else in your dress cuz you basically designed the whole thing.  Prices range $250-$400.  Call for an appointment.
5	Just purchased my wedding dress from Bella's!   Although it is known for bridesmaid dresses, Bella's also carries simple, destination-style wedding dresses.  I've been working with Cecily and she has been fantastic.  I've gone into the store three times to try it on and each time she's given me her undivided attention.    I would definitely recommend Bella's for anyone looking for bridesmaid, formal party or a destination wedding dress! Definitely call for an appointment as they like to give all brides / bridesmaids their full attention.
4	I purchased a hard to find destination gown at Bella about a month before my wedding. I was able to get it during their sample sale for 50% off -- a grand for a simple old Holywood style gown still seems a bit too high for me, but I took the plunge when I found nothing comparable around town. I found the service to be very friendly and attentive. Take your gown to Anna's Alterations and tell them your dress is from Bella. They will give you an additional 10% off.
5	Was in town for work and stopped in to check out the sample sale. I have a couple functions coming up and thought it would be worth it to take a look. I had the best luck!  Kendra was so helpful and picked out some great things for me to try. I found two gorgeous dresses, very reasonably priced.
