5	Cyphers the Center for Urban Arts is the place to be! Took my daughter for b-girl classes there recently. House and Meknow got down. The center offers a variety of artforms for a very reasonable price, including Breaking, DeeJaying, and Aerosol art workshops. They also offer ZUMBA classes. With so much to offer, they are bound to have something the whole family can enjoy.
5	My six year old son attends their Kids Breakin' class on Mondays @ 5pm and he absolutely loves this place. The instructor, Bboy House, is excellent!  He challenges the kids to learn proper technique and really encourages them to make each performance their own. If we lived closer to the center I'm sure we would be there at least two or three times a week as they have a great assortment of classes/activities that you won't find anywhere else in the valley. The classes are affordable and there is a real sense of community and passion for the urban arts when you walk through the door.   Check out their website http://602cyphers.com
5	This is the comment of the location and appearance so did not enter in. You go to walk from civiccenter Station Red Line subway Metro. It becomes back from climbing & one compartment main street from the station. Please remember well the location of the station. From the main street it is difficult to find the station I hesitated a little. It is essential in the building, but it is pretty light and shiny hits sunlight. All there is no part of the straight line is the feeling that has been made in the curve. Curvaceous! ! Is. Please look from the back from the table. I can enjoy the beauty of the curve
