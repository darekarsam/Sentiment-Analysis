5	Small, quaint, so FRENCH! You feel as if you are in the heart of France. I heart the duck confit. SO GOOD!! It is a bring your own wine here. Excellent service and attention to detail. You will not be disappointed. Good for small groups here.
5	As usual, Guillame is the best of hosts.  I had not eaten at Petit Resto in years, and he had since moved to a larger, fancier location.  But, on one call, he took my reservation and gave me the best table in the house!  The food - I had the cassoulet special, totally filling, totally greasy (in the great way that the French use grease!), and delicious.  My guest, a brochet of scallops and jumbo shrimp (hate that oxymoron...).  Perfect!  I would eat there every night, except I might get fat...but I love to be able to bring my own wine.
5	I finally got to try this restaurant after passing it for years. We were a group of about 15. Despite the name this is a great place for a group. There was an ever larger group near us. They can separate the groups with curtains. No disappointments. The service was great. Pizza as a starter had an excellent crust. The Oso Buco de cerf was amazing, on a bed or risotto. The only thing a little weird was the chimicuri on the side. The three chocolates for desert was very good, but too much after such a big meal.Bring your own wine helps keep the bill down.I will be back.
