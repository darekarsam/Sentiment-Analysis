5	TAKE OUT ONLY....Saw their flyer and decided to give a try...so far their mix plate turned out to be the #1.Quality of the food is OK not he the superior but price is also similar to the food.Customer service is OK....good arabic take out place compared to others around that area...Been a frequent customer for the past few months.....
4	Just discovered this place and it's awesome!!! We ordered Al Quds Mix and 30 wings and boy we weren't disappointed. The portions were huge, very generous and everything was cooked to perfection. I don't usually like Arabic food but the food here had great taste, same thing for the wings, they were tender, juicy and delicious. Very satisfied with this place and the price just can't be beat.
1	Most horrible service i have ever received in my life. Extremely disrespectful and tells me to hurry up and says he doesn't have time to answer my questions. I liked the food the last time i tried it, but in my opinion the worst customer experience i have ever received.
