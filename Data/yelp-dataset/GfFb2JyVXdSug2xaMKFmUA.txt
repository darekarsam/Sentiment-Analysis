5	Took my 17 month old here for a free introductory class, not knowing what to expect. I was pleased to find an extremely nice facility--the entire room was padded (a toddler parent's dream!), and every staff member I met was lovely to deal with. The parent-child class we went to (which was well-timed at 45 minutes) was a good mix of being organized but also allowing lots of free play for toddlers to run around. My toddler had a blast here, and it was great exercise for her and good to get her ready for a long nap afterwards. I also appreciated that  the staff was not pushy about getting you to sign up for classes afterwards. Also, while the prices are a little steep here, there is no requirement that you enroll in a huge number of classes, and the gym also seems to be pretty good about letting you cancel and make up classes. Given the easy enrollment process and the quality of the facility, I think the prices are actually ok. Looking forward to going there with my little one in the future.
5	I've been bringing my son here for a month now and love it! Miss Kim is awesome, so easy-going and inviting. My son loves to participate in whatever she is teaching at the time. So glad we tried this place first!
5	Can't say enough about the owners and staff of the Little Gym - we had a groupon type deal for another location that had closed, I called this location and they honored the coupon even though they didn't have to. My daughter took classes during the summer and loved it, the instructors are all friendly and appear to really enjoy working with the kids. Since taking classes, we have booked Parents Nights Out and a birthday party.
