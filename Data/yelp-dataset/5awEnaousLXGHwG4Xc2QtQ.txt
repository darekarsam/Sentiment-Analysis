5	My kids love this place. Great for large groups. Pizza tastes good also. Kids love the arcade area. Reasonable price for what you get.
3	Had a good time like always, and their pizza is still some of my favorite. However, I was there for my son's birthday and a couple of the games that he really enjoys playing were out of order. Plus there were a couple of other games that just ate our tokens. It was still "A-OK" but I have had better trips there. Plus the size of their cups always drive me nuts!
2	Despite updating their logo and new advertising emphasizing healthy choices, it's still Peter Piper Pizza. The pizza is affordable. The drinks less so. Game tokens don't go as far as you'd expect because so many games require two or more.We opted for basic single topping pepperoni and sausage pizzas due to the preferences of the young ones in our party. Not horrible, but... There was one twenty something with us who loved the pizza, however, sentimentally reliving all those birthday parties of her youth.We came on a Saturday, a mistake of course. Our two little girls (ages four and five) were elbowed out of a game they were learning by an aggressive older boy. I intervened, pointing out he was stealing by taking over their game in progress. His parent was disinterested. Youthful Peter Piper Pizza employees were nowhere in sight. I had to pull the boy away myself. The game area was very chaotic all around. Definitely some more employee monitoring is needed during the busy times.My suggestion? Go to Chuck E Cheese if you have young children. It's safer for them. The tokens go farther (less confusing for little ones since most games require only one token). Security at the door is better. A minimum wage teenager dressed as a mouse. Even the pizza, while not great, is preferable. And cost is only a little higher. If you just want a cheap lunchtime buffet, or if your kids are a little older, PPP may still be fine.
