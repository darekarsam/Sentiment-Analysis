5	The realtors at Savvy + Co are top notch!  They are extremely personable and will bend over backwards to help you find your dream home.  They are first in the market for trend-setting however, still manage to maintain a down-to-earth work mentality.  My favorite realtor would be Eileen Nelis!  She is extremely thorough as well as a fantastic listener.  She will walk you through the entire process of home buying to make sure you feel confident and knowledgeable with your final decision.
5	This review is really about Jeff King, one of the agents at Savvy.Jeff helped us find a house in Plaza Midwood, and simultaneously helped us sell our last house, also in Plaza Midwood.  We wound up finding a great house only a block and a half from our old one.Jeff really impressed us with his knowledge of the state of Plaza Midwood real estate.  He specializes in this area and it showed.He also bent over backwards to make things run smoothly, and was in constant contact with every development.In the end, what could have been a very stressful ordeal went very smoothly.  We closed on the sale of our old house days after moving into the new one.  Without Jeff's guidance, I doubt that would have been possible.Thanks, Jeff!
