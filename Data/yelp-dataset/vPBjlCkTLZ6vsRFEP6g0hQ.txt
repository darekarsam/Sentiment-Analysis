5	I was able to return an item no questions asked and use the store credit towards a new item. Hassle free!
4	Yeah, it's a big box store, but they've got so much cool stuff.  When my wife said she wanted to go there, I was just happy that a BevMo was across the street.  But we never got to BevMo and I was happy.  It sounds lame to marvel at "helpful" doodads for around the house, but there are so many cool things there that you're sure to get some good stuff.
3	Everything and the kitchen sink, just waayyy to much stuff....I get lost on what I came for. I am just not a big shopper for home stuff but I have came here to buy some christmas gifts or gifts in general. I am not a hater I would prob rate these stores higher if I was more of a shopper for these types of items. Do not avoid this location based on a 3 star review, prices are good and they sells quality items here. Visit with confidence.
