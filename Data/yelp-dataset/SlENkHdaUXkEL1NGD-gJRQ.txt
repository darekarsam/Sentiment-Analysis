4	Not a fan of At&t but I bought a $20 go-phone here for a pre-paid option to use while I am in Mexico so I can still run my business while out of town.  My Verizon phone wont work there so it is a life saver.  I cant believe I was able to buy a phone for $20 with no contract and pre-pay for my minutes.  International calls are $ .25 cents per minute and per text but worth every penny when its something urgent.  Its not a fancy phone but it works.
5	Mahdi is amazing! Go see him for great deals on Tablets and phone service, he won't let you down! He is super friendly and always does whatever he can to help.
5	Wrong store! Sorry!
4	Mahdi is my go too guy but ever since the new crew came in they are so rude man its like they don't want my money or something.... but go to Mahdi he's the man he will do what he can to make you happy ....
