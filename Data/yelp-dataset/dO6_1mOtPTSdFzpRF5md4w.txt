1	Bad staff, foul language, no customer service skills, ruined order, Would it surprise you if I told you they were unfriendly and nasty too?  Welcome to Pizza Hut at 6017 E McKellips Rd. Mesa, AZ
4	Not sure of the negative experiences here.  Ordered my pie on-line - said it would be ready in 17 minutes....I got there with 3 minutes remaining on the clock and out of the oven it came!  Fresh and piping hot.  It was soo good too.  They made it correctly and the price was as quoted on-line.As far as customer service, there was a lady in front of me who I swear never ordered a pizza in her life nor had she heard of Pizza Hut bc she was asking all sorts of questions about crust, ingredients, cheese, etc.  Poor guy.  The other service gal could see this lady was going to be a while so she called me to the side, got my name, my order, then cashed me out and handed me my pizza.   :)
