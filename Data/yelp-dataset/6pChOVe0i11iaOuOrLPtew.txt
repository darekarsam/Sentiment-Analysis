5	My yard looks fantastic!  Thanks, Ivan.
5	Listened to our wishes, submitted a plan, worked with us as we revised the plan both in cost and design, did the work and we have enjoyed the results for two years now.  I have referred this company to my neighbors, friends and acquaintances--I'm that happy with the results.
5	I had Brnilovich Landscapes put a number of plants and trees in my back yard. They also installed an irrigation drip system to the plants. Great work! Very affordable! Highly recommended!
5	Ivan and his crew did a great job redoing our backyard.  They put in rocks with a grassy area surrounded by curbing.  They also added several fruit trees and many plants along with a drip system and a sprinkler system to keep everything green.  We have been very happy with their ongoing maintenance service for both the back and front yards.  Ivan always responds quickly if I have any questions or concerns.
