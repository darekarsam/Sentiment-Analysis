5	AMAZING BACON.Helpful staff.
5	Thanks to the previous reviewers for this one.I had just left a neighbouring butcher in disgust, and thankfully this place was just a few doors down.Greeted with a big smile I already knew I was in the right place. I bought just over a kilo of saucisson for my journey back to the West Coast.The dried sausage hanging on racks brought back fond memories of my culinary travels in Hungary eleven years ago. Hey, even the snow falling outside added to the moment!However, it is taking a lot of willpower to not tear into the brown paper package and gobble away. Resist temptation!Well... maybe just a bite.
5	The best butcher I've ever been to. I live a few blocks away and I go here for all my meat needs. If you call ahead of time they can usually order anything you want and have it there within a day or two. They are very helpful with anything. Tell them you need meat for ___ and for ___ amount of people and BOOM you have it for a remarkable price. Love this place and recommend it.
5	This place is incredible. I walked in on a whim and within seconds I knew I needed to get some meat from here. I got 2 8 ounce spencer steaks and 2 8 ounce new york strips. It came out to 17 bucks, some of the cheapest I've ever seen and the cheapest in Montreal. I have to say they were some of the best steaks I've ever had. It's all Alberta beef and it really shows. They were so good I finished all the steaks in less than two days...I love this place, can't wait to go back tomorrow.
5	Called to confirm and Charcuterie Fairmount are selling local beef only these days following the recall of Albertan.
4	I would always buy my steaks at the grocery store just because if the convenience. A while back I decided to try this place out to see the difference and I haven't bought steaks anywhere else since. This place is awesome! The steaks are awesome! The service is awesome! And the prices are awesome! Never buy your meat at the grocery store again!
