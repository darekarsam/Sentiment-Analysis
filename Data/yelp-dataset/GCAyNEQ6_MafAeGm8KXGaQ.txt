5	I was traveling throughout Europe and was in Edinburgh. I must have slept wrong or tweaked my back somehow, and I had so much pain in my mid-lower back.  It hurt just to take a breath! I found Nick through Yelp and made an appointment. As an American, massage is a part of holistic medicine to keep you healthy and is widely utilized in the States. Nick is committed to his role as, in my opinion, a health care provider and is extremely knowledgeable on all things musculoskeletal. He identified the issue through asking me questions and then assessing the muscle group.  Nick found that I had a problem with a set of muscles around my 12th rib on my right side of my back and he worked on those muscles for the hour.  Thank goodness I went to Nick to help me because I slept a million times better that night and felt pretty damn good the next day.  Thank you for helping me Nick!!!!!
