5	This Desert Schools location is great! Whenever I need to deposit a check, I can get in and out quickly. The staff members are very friendly and helpful. Most recently, I took my dog with me through their drive-thru, and the teller put a dog treat into the canister thing that holds the money. I thought that was a nice touch! ;)
5	I used desert school for a new truck I bought at the dealer ship. But then later found out the dealer ship went to another bank with out me knowing about. One of the bankers called me to inform me the application wasn't with desert school. The interest rate was 3.2% with the other bank. I went back to the deal ship asked them to switch it to desert schools. Once the paperwork was finalized my interest rate dropped to a 2.79. Thank you desert schools for doing your due diligence.
