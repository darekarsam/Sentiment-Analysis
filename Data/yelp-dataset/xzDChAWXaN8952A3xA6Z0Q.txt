3	Little unassuming, in fact hard to find and a bit sketchy, location behind another restaurant in North Las Vegas - but the torta I had was really good. We were actually headed to another torta place a couple doors down that I hear is wonderful but the other place was remodeling and we were told that this place was good, and it was. I had the Torta Pierna - some sort of shredded pork (I think)with lettuce and tomato and a red sauce, I am sure I am not doing the explanation justice. The only complaint was service was really, really slow and there was only one other group in the place. But two sandwiches and a drink for $12 - not bad. Also, tried the carne asada torta and it was okay but nothing memorable. I would go for the pierna over the carne asada. This place was a bakery too, I didn't try anything but they had a decent selection of Mexican pastries and there were quite a few customers for the bakery why we were waiting. So in closing, I would go hear again if I felt like a torta but I still must try the place a couple doors down to the east of this location.
5	The menudo here is awesome just like mom's makes, and prices are dirt cheap. It's a bakery so you get fresh bread to dip in the broth for just 50 cents more. You get all the condiments oregano,chopped onions,limes, and chile if you want it spicier. The outside looks like a bland brick bldg, but don't judge a book by its cover, there's great mexican food inside.
5	Supper good food. I went 3 times last week. They have a ton of selection. The bread that has cream cheese and ham was so so so so good. Ummmmmm
