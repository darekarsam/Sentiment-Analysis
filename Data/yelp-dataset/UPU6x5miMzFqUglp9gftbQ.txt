5	$250 for a cabana + a dedicated server + a bluetooth stereo + misters+ 4 chaise lounges+ poolside massages = perfection on a 104 degree monday in Las Vegas. Its definitely the way to go.
4	Three pools- confidence builders, all of them. No hot, skanky girls. Just real folks...sometimes too real. Here's a challenge- ask anyone in the pool where the nearest restroom is.
5	They have a few pools. I was there with my family. The best one for families is the one that is zero entry - 3 1/2 ft. It has small fountains for the kids to play with. Water is warm and clean. Many lounge chairs but kinda challenging to find some in the shade, so bring hats, sunglasses and plenty of sunscreen. The pool provides towels as you enter. And don't forget your room key as you need it to get into pool area. There is a Starbucks conveniently located before you head to the pool area so you grab some snacks and cafe drinks. Or bring your own. The Pool Bar provides drinks and lunch food too.
4	The ARIA offers several pools for their guests to enjoy. The pros: super relaxing- remarkable view- great music- and A+ poolside service! The cons: overpriced cocktails (almost $20 for a 16 oz), and I'm not a fan of the hours they stay open (9AM-6PM).
