2	This little place needs help...I think the employees want to please their customers...but service is slow.
1	Worst place ever! Don't eat there! Every time I go, they always forget something! Worst place ever!!!!!!!
1	Don't get me wrong I love this place but today was enough to make me say no more chances, first order of hot wings were under cooked called back got them replaced and even waited 20min for them to be fresh took them home and guess what, still under cooked, I'm thinking their fry oil isn't hot enough to cook these hot wings throughly.
1	Alway out of something and what moles it worse is the charge 39cents more to use my. Debit card , this place need to get with it .
4	As a girl who was raised in Arkansas, I do, from time to time, get a hankerin' for fried chicken. I didn't feel like going to the store, washing dishes, etc, so I headed to this KFC.KFC has changed a lot since I was a kid. It seems a lot cleaner. And I certainly don't recall not one, not two, but three cameras at the registers. But that's the world we live in, I guess. Regardless, this particular location is extremely clean, the employees seem to actually enjoy their jobs, and the food is made pretty quickly. In fact, last night, Vanessa actually special-ordered some chicken tenders to be made a la original recipe, instead of crispy, which is the only way listed on the menu. How nice!The sides now come in reusable containers. So reuse them! There's no sense in putting more trash in our landfills if you can reuse them...for food, crafts, cannabis...whatever.Side note: in Cabot, Arkansas, KFC has a buffet. And a chicken liver meal. The buffet, I could do without, but I could dig some liver every once in awhile. Hint hint.
