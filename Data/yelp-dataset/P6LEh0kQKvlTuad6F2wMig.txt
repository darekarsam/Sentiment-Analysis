5	WunderWorst is great with a huge selection of sausages. A small operation but boy do you leave full. The owner is extremely friendly and will always take his time and explain all the different meats and flavors you can choose from. I usually order 2 sausages in buns with a side of curly fries. The container is usually packed so full it can barely close the fries are great, but the sausages have always been amazing!! The knackwurst, merguez and lamb sausages are my favorite. I have heard good things about the Jamaican and diablo as well from friends i have been there with. There is usually sauerkraut and 2 types of mustard on the side to dress the sausages. All this for and a drink for under $10 is a bargain and i can never finish all the fries.
