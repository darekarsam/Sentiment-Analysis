5	Well, this is just a delight. Our friend Heid works at the bakery so we thought we'd stop by in the morning before leaving for Boston where we were performing that night. Knowing Heidi we knew it would have to be a top spot and indeed it was. Great croisants, great little tarts, super European style bread (even in New York it's a real challenge to find tasty and healthy - at least 13 grains, please - so I can appreciate the real deal when I taste it). Even the chocolate milk was superb. We left happy but also sad that we'd have to say "bye, bye" to our friend Heidi and the rest of our friends in Montreal. Herremannen dug the bakery so much that he purchased flowers at he florist next door in order to express his delight and appreciation. And we shall return for more chocolate croisants and fruit tarts at Boulangerie Le Fournil, in this stellar part of Montreal.- SL
4	If you love old-fashioned bread pudding, then you need to come to Le Fournil ASAP.They have, by far. the best bread pudding in the city. I'm not a fan of their creative additions to bread pudding (i.e berries, orange etc.) but just their simple version of bread, milk, eggs, sugar and a smattering of raisins. Pieces are quite filling and while they are excellent desserts in the wintertime, they might be a bit heavy for the warmer months. They are amazing for breakfast as well! It's worth a stop.
1	Sadly not as good as it used to be.  The owners are super nice, but the pies have gone downhill.  I used to love them. No longer.
5	I live in Vancouver, but when I am in Montreal I go directly to this bakery.  Everything they make is amazing.  I wish I could bring everything they make back to Vancouver with me.
