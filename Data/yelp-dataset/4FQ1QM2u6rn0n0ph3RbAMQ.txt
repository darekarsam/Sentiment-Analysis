4	Y'know, in passing by this place it's hard not to get nostolgic.  My parents used to take me here all the time when I was a kid.  These days I'll sometimes get gifts here for my niece Allison and my nephew Brian.  S.W. Randall emphasizes toys and games based on their play value http://www.swrandalltoys.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=26&Itemid=61  I've bought my niece and nephew games, dolls, Legos, etc here.  Ah, but they are growing kids and one day they're gonna be too old for a place like this.  My husband Rick and I don't have kids of our own.There just aren't a lot of toy stores like this anymore (thank you Walmart).  It's a fun place to come in and look around.
4	The employees are very well-trained. The store owner is actually not bad either. This is a Pittsburgh staple that's managed to survive despite the existence of competitors, including the internet. It's a great way to ensure that your kids actually like the toys before you purchase it.It's going to be around a little while.
5	Lovely place and also playing their part in the community with their lovely window displayed Lego competition for kids.
1	We are very disappointed with the management, as they refused to let our kids use their restroom. What kind of toy store doesn't let kids use its bathroom? They need to change their bathroom policy before we go back to spend our money there!
