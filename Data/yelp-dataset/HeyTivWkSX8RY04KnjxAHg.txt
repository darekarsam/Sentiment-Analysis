3	It's allright.
2	This airport is indeed one of my favorites and I normally stop in at the news shops, but this one was a huge let down.The staff were not friendly at all and it got worse when I didn't make a donation to whatever they were collecting for at the moment.The selection was ok, but there were no decent hats, which is what I typically pick up!Thankfully there are plenty of other places to look around in while you are waiting on your plane!
