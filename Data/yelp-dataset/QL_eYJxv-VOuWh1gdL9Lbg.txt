5	Great service. Waiting room is clean and inviting. The PA saw us quickly. They were able to do a chest x-ray right on sight. The PA was thorough, patient and took her time and didn't make us feel rushed. I for sure recommend this urgent care.

5	This morning I went to the facility at Central and Dunlap. Corneal abrasion, my 4th but 1st in this eye. In the past I went to the ER.  A corneal scratch is hideously painful, I took liquid morphine last night that I had from another recent injury. Then again this morning.  I couldn't drive far with one eye.  I was hesitant to go with such a serious eye injury but WOW.  From front office to treatment everyone was very caring. Dr. Boyer PA and the medical assistant were great. When I left I was confident that what caused the abrasion was no longer in my eye, I could see from the eye.  II would most certainly return in the future as an option to the ER.
