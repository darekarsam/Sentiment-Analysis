5	LOVE the staff---pharmacy was quick and communicated well.  Sally is the true delight in the store!
1	Horrible people behind that pharmacy counter!!! The one girl in her late twenties to early thirties is nuts and does not listen at all. They need to mind their own business and stop asking why you taking certain medications. Don't waste your time at the Anthem Walgreens pharmacy. ..
1	I purchased an item in Tucson, didn't use it and returned it once home back in Anthem. They couldn't/wouldn't refund the tax difference (a difference greater than $0.25). Other establishments can do this - not Walgreens.
