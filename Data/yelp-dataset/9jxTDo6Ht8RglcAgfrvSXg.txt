5	Amazing new tamale shop downtown Phoenix that just opened up near 18th Ave and Van Buren St. Great service, all local ingredients with chile from Hatch, New Mexico ("chile Capitol of the world").  Best tasting tamale I have ever had!
5	I really enjoyed the tamales and enchilada's at the Steamed Tamale. I think they have a great idea of taking a tamale dinner home in their "Tamale Tote" tamales, rice and beans.
5	Amazing new restaurant with excellent food and service! Chiles from Hatch, New Mexico! Would recommend to anyone craving a tamale or taste of authentic Mexican food located near 18th Ave and Van Buren St.
5	Delicious tamales made with New Mexico Hatch chile... Generous portions served at a very reasonable price! If you like it HOT, ask for the Owner Brian ' s red salsa... Tomato going in... Fire going down!!! Come se dice' delicioso?
4	The green tamales were delicious. i walked to the Steamed Tamale because i work just  2 minutes away. By the time i got back to the office needless to say the tamales were gone. Worth the trip and reasonably priced. Owner/staff were very friendly. I hope they stay around.
5	Thought this place was really ghetto at first then a friend told me I had to eat here. I was definitely blown away by the food. This guy makes the best green tamales I've ever had. Will definitely return!
2	My expectations were crushed. Phoenix needs a Tucson Tamale like place with a wide selection of fun and delcious tamales.Alas the Steamed Tamale only offers two, A beef tamale and a corn one. Even more confusing is that by default the non meat tamale comes in a green meet sauce.The corn Tamale it self was bland and their normal prices are not cheap. There are a few seats inside and a few dirty tables on the patio. Not very inviting.This was a one time visit for me.
