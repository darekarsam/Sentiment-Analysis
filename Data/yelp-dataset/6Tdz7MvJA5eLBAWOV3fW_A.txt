3	Slightly scruffy buta fine low-key spot exceptfor beer pong Tuesdays.
3	The "other" McGillian's bar of choice (besides Gerts, and we don't talk about Peel Pub). One of those places where it doesn't seem right to order anything besides cheap beer, and then only by the pitcher. Bleue, Bud Lite, and 2-3 brands of Keith's are the only beers on tap. I'm not convinced that they even stock hard liquor, though I imagine they must; similarly, they apparently have food, but I've never heard of anybody ordering it. Average prices. Bartenders are just barely polite enough.
3	McGilligan undergrad pub. You don't smell the urine until you get to the back of the bar. Divy place. One pool table and you can challege your friends at foosball. They do have hard alcohol here, but most people just knock back pitchers of light beer. Expect to see drunk undergrads falling over each other making out by the end of the night. Uhh, I guess they have a kitchen and serve food? I would never eat here.
4	Cheap beer, lots of cute guys from McGill....this is becoming the unofficial gay bar for McGill hotties... I love it...very popular among the jocks and the closeted guys
5	Rad bar. Shot tequila, slammed beer and threw up latkes outside the front door. Sick night.
