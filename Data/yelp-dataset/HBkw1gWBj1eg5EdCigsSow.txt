5	Have been going to South Shore Barber Shop for many years.  Very friendly barbers and always a consistently good haircut at a reasonable price.  Took my 15 month old son there for his first haircut and they made him feel comfortable and worked with him.  They even gave him a certificate for his first haircut and put some of his hair in an envelope for a keepsake.Definitely recommend.
2	Great service, but way too expensive for me.  I get a buzz cut.  No frills.  Just go over my head with a really short blade.  $16 is way to much for that and the most I have paid anywhere in the country.  It should be around $10 - $12 at most.  I will never go back.
5	Best $16 hair cut in town. Straight razor, too. These people know how to cut men's hair!
2	I just received a haircut from this place and despite how friendly they may be the fact remains that this is the worst hair cut I've received since basic training. The only reason they received two stars is because of the customer service. My hair was about four inches in length on the top, I asked to take a little off the top and fade the sides with a #2. She decided that meant to take a #4 to the top of my head and #1.5 to the sides. That means she took about 3 1/2 off the top of my head! Again these are nice people but they just can't cut hair. For $16 you can definitely find a better barber in Vegas.
