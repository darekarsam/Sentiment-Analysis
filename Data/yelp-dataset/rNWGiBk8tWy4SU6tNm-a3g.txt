4	I stopped in to pick up a birthday cake for a friend's party and found the yummiest ice cream cake - Bananas Foster!  It has vanilla & banana ice cream, swirled with chopped pecan pralines, brown sugar & cinnamon on a vanilla cookie crust.   Everyone loved it!!The store is a nice change of pace when I am not doing my usual shopping at one of the many area Harris Teeters or Trader Joe's. The only negative about the store is that they never seem to have enough cashiers working and the self service checkout is not as nice as the ones they use at HT.
3	How many supermarket chains do we really need in the Queen City. Between the Teeter, the Lion, the Germans (Aldi), the Lo, Super Targets and Super Wal-Marts, plus the random one-offs like Trader Joe's and Super G, there is a whole lot of competition going on. And all this competition doesn't seem to have reduced or leveled the prices.Lowe's is a smaller entrant to this party with a focus on the Carolinas and Virginia region. Inside, the store seemed to be a lot like the Teeters I've visited and the prices were similar. They have a shopper loyalty program as well and you'll want to join that program if you want to get the lower prices on the specials.The store is very clean and the shelves were all very well stocked. Whoever is doing the leveling here is doing a great job. Great dairy and meat sections, but the produce area was not too large. All the wheels on my cart worked fine. I also managed to find the clearance area and grabbed a couple big bargains from there.I can't really say I would be back - while they have a great selection, the prices seem higher than elsewhere.
