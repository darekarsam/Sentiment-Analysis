5	We had an uneven concrete slab, stubborn thinset that refused to come up and a kitchen floor that needed to be tiled before family came into town for Thanksgiving. I found Optimum Solutions ad on Craigslist and called Joe at 10am. By noon he had one of his crew at our house to even our floors. They were back the next day at 8am sharp to start work. By 4pm the job was done and grout was laid the next morning. Joe personified professionalism and expedient service at a supremely competitive price! My wife and I are extremely happy with the work and so is my wallet. If you need a quality job done by one of the rare contractors that take just as much pride in their customer service as they do in their work than Optimum Solutions should be your first and last call. Thank you Joe and Eric (installer). We will be back very soon for our bathrooms!
