2	It's pricey for the quality of the food, located on the first floor of the Alt Hotel, in an industrial and still under development neighbourhood... I had the Portobello Burger, nothing spectacular, my companion had the penne, she was not impressed, neither was I. Decent customer service..out of my list
2	Apparently being the correct demographic for this place, I recd a coupon for a free drink in the mail. Coupons are always challenging for staff to treat graciously. So a fair test for trying a new place. They failed miserably though the Rickard's white I had was nice.
3	Tried it yesterday after work with 4 of my friends. 3 good things:- service (adorable and funny)- view of downtown mtl from the terrace- atmosphere - music and some fire at night2 bad things:- quantity of food (really small) 29$ for really one plate of salmon tartar with 10 fries :/- the drinks are not well made - mojito was a bit disappointing.but all in all worth a chill out, after work, definitely go for wine or beer you will enjoy it, especially if it is a date. but don't go there hungry... :)
2	I had one of their monster salads today - it was actually quite tasty (Thai need salad and my friend had the ahi tuna). The salad mix is a bit of everything with a bit of meat.  Not too bad but unsure about the $20+ for a salad.
4	Burgers are very good :) The place is nice and the service was great!Exceeded expectations, really don't know why some people only rated 2 stars.
