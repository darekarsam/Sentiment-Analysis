4	Yum.  You're going to enjoy the authentic traditional Mexican cuisine here like their tacos, but don't be afraid to try the Honduran or Salvadoran items, too.  I liked the pupusa and chicken tamal.  Spicing the food up with some side orders of guacamole or pico de gallo can be a real taste adventure and can make the difference between an average meal and a terrific one.  This part of South Blvd. isn't really the best part of town, but don't let that scare you off.  They also do carry out.
2	Comalapa tries for every south of the border flavor in our hemisphere - they have a huuuuge menu - but for us, nothing stood out. At all. Like eating shadows of the favorites we ordered, things were pretty blah.Papusas - eh - mild in corn and cheese flavors, a little tough. Got the "cheese and veggie" ones, they came with some interesting orange slaw I'd never seen that had an odd black pepper thing happening. Most interesting part of the meal.Rancheros - skip - chopped peppers, bland tomato sauce.Rice - something chinese-fried about it. Unexpected and unwelcome.Salsa, chips - watery, bland and fried waaay earlier, consecutively (to be fair, we hit them 10 minutes after they opened). Our waitress was sweet, and brought me some hot salsa. Not bad. All garlic. Owner guy greeted us loudly and enthusiastically, but if the food's meh...I'd estimate 90 percent of the menu is meat, and I hope that's where they excel, because for veggies, this ain't a stop to make.
3	Can't judge a place from the outside. Comalapa is a friendly little place. And the food is good. Yuca and chicharon... great!!! This place is missing the wow factor which I think is the lack of recipes. The 1st time I went here the pupusas were spot on. Then today I ordered the same pupusa and they were not the same.
