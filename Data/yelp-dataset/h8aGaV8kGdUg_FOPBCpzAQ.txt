3	I love the roasted chicken and the ribs here, especially when cooked and seasoned to near-perfection. The salad bar offers a wide variety of veggies, salads, soups, and fruits; it usually comes free with a protein dish but you can also order it alone.The service is the only reason I'm deducting points here, they waiters could've been more friendly and caring; my water was never filled unless I demanded it, and the waiters seem pretty careless about handling the plates and my food.Other than that, the place is very good for a gathering or family dinner.
2	food was good. but over priced. I tryed to dogy bag my left over food and the waiter tryed to charge me. never saw that before
3	Have been coming here with the family over the years. Food is always good, fresh, served hot. The salad bar is usually well stocked.The problem I hate to say is with the service. It is hit and miss. For example today, the waitress we had was not up to par. Maybe she was having a bad day, didn't like her section, etc. Sorry all I wanted is to have a good service. She was quick to take our order, bring it to our table and then just disappeared. The place was not very busy (1:30PM) who knows? All I know is that we never saw her till it was time to pay. Had to ask another waitress for a refill for my son.Decent food but they need to step up their game in the service department.
5	We go at least 3 times a month, always had great service, greeted with a smile and our "regular" waitress knows exactly how to make us happy. We never have to ask for refills she's always on ball!!The food is great, chicken tenders are our favourite! Salad bar is always good I have nothing but good things to say!!The price is ok for the portions of food!!Bravo!
