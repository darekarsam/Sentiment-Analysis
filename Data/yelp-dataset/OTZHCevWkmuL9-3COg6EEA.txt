4	This store is super clean and the employees are nice! They have Fresh Brewed Tea!!! And Chocodiles..those elusive snacks are hard to find but the employee informed they are a regular item!Wohoo!
4	Slurpies, candy, chips, nachos, hot dogs, oh my! 7-Eleven is pretty darn awesome. This particular location gets extra stars for the non-scary location, cleanliness of the store, that everything is well-stocked, and the super nice store clerk who is always very helpful and never gives me weird looks when I wander around for 10+ minutes picking up all kinds of snacks and then pay with like 4 different gift cards.
