4	Great spot near UNC Charlotte... Great restaurants and bars all surrounding the lake.
5	This is my favorite place in charlotte, with my grandmothers nursing home across the street and me traveling all the time on an fixed amount to spend per city it's great too just sit by the pond and people watch.
5	Love this place...A daily people watching spot, read a news paper, get a walk in around the pond, plenty of spots with good food, good drinks, and. All around chill spot...
3	Cool location, near the lake (pond) but cool.
