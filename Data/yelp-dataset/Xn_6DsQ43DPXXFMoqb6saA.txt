5	I wanted to post my first review about this store and the best sales associate Meghan! She is the one to go see about any phone or tablet issues. She helped me get all my music back on my new iPad too! She also got me 25$ free dollars with Isis mobile wallet and now I use it as my savings account. Go see her if you want a free 25$ if you have an android device!! THANK YOU MEGHAN ALLARD!!!!
5	I had a unique problem and lost all of my information from my phone. Alberto Beccerra spent hours fixing my phone even though he did not have to. Other people in the store did not want to help me but Alberto  did everything he could to help me. Thanks to Alberto everything is back on my phone and everything is working better than it was before thank you very much Alberto I appreciate you.
