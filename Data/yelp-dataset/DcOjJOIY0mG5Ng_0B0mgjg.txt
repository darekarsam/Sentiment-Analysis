5	I started working out w/ AmenZone a couple of years ago when they toured around the valley. I made sure I attended their community classes when I could. I was super excited when the Biltmore location opened. I've officially been a member since October 2013 and I just can't get enough. Every class is different, the trainers are great, and the results are greater. By eating clean and committing yourself to AmenZone, you can most definitely achieve your dream body. The price is absolutely worth it, believe me.
5	Phenomenal workouts--I can see my abs again for the first time since college. Rich keeps my muscles guessing and growing. If you want an athletic build without the injury risk associated with crossfit style Olympic lifting, this is the place for you.
1	I've never called a place that didn't want to help me as much as this place. I called because I wanted to hear from a real employee why they like their product and I was just referred to the website... After I expressed why the website wasn't where I wanted to get my information he didn't even know what to say... Never offered for me to come in and look at the place which I was actually on my way to check out. I was ultimately "dismissed". Such a bummer.
