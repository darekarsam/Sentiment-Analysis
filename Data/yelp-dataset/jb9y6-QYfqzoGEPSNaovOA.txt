5	Great stuff and nice staff!Loved this little place with all the cool stuff - bought two items here that I didn't even think existed - darn - I thought I could invent them.The prices seemed a little on the high side, but because of the specialty and uniqueness of the items - it seems fine!Though the place was small - it had a lot in it and the staff were some of the nicest folks I've met!
5	Everyone here is helpful.  Fantastic hardware.  I purchased a set of Denon in-ear headphones here two years ago, and I still use them daily.  They will let you try just about anything.  Also they have replacement in-ear pieces if you lose yours.Not cheap.  You get what you pay for.
1	Do not shop with this company and particularly with this individual shop. I bought a $100 pair of headphones here that do not work. I spoke directly with the manager who would not exchange the item without a receipt and the box. He was more worried about his "inventory" than taking care of the customer. I will never purchase anything from this company again. They do not stand behind their products.
