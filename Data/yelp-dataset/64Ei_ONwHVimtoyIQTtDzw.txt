4	Very clean laundry in a big parking lot. Coin-less. You buy a card with cash from the machine. The end to fumbling for quarters. Attendant is there to help and sells supplies. Next to a Goodwill for extra shopping as your clothes dry.
4	This place is nice. Clean and bright. A lot of available washers and dryers. Must convert money into a card to use for this laundromat. No coins, cards, or cash going into the machines. Bring cash. They have tvs up also if you get bored. In a good area. I would come here again. Hopefully I don't need to though. Let's get that washer fixed!
