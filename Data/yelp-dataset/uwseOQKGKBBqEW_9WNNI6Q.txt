3	Decent service but they are about to dramatically jack up the prices. They must have nearly all their mailboxes rented.
1	This place is the worst post office I have ever been to. They asked if I wanted insurance over $100, I said no, they asked me if my package was in a rush, I said no. They never asked if I wanted any insurance or if I would like the package tracked. So I'm thinking wow they want to charge me over $40 to mail 3 packages! That don't weigh more than 4lbs. all together? I watched the scale and they tried telling me that one package weighed more than it actually did and then they tried saying well it's going all the way to New York (they said the package weighed two lbs. when I clearly saw the scale show 1.21lbs.). Also the final cherry on top that made me walk out the door was when I was told that I must pay for priority shipping because the box that the company shipped to me was a priority shipping box??? I've never had a post office force me to pay a premium on a box that was going to be sent back. All they had to do if it was really that important is mark out the print that stated priority mail with a sharpie. Idk I just felt that the place was poorly ran, they did everything in their power to up charge, and places like that will not receive my business.
