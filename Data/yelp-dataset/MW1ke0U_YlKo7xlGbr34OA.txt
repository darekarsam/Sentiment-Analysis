1	Simon Kutar runs this Sunshine Group Homes and he has way too many to be able to give the kids and staff adequate supervision and a loving environment. Try about 25 group homes. Most of his homes are licensed for 8 to 10 kids each. He lets each house manager run their program how they see fit. So if the one house manager was a religious nut then they're forcing their personal views on the children. Another manager; a pot head that will hang out at the group home with her pot buddy while she sends one staff to take 8 kids on a outing. Expressing one's concerns to Simon is useless. Best thing to do is make a call to community care licensing / DES and let them investigate. If enough people complain than they will look into the complaints.
1	Simon is so unprofessional. I interviewed for a position he did not smile nor shake my hand when I walked in his office, he barely looked up from my resume to look at me. I waited for 40 minutes before he saw me and then I was out of this VERY awkward interview within 5 minutes. THANKS FOR WASTING MY TIME! He DID offer me some other position with crappy hours that I was not even applying for. If you go for an interview be sure to ask questions about the specific position. All the girls at the front desk were very nice and helpful(why I gave 1 star). Simon was either having a bad day or he is just a jerk with zero people skills.
