5	I have gone to this place ever since they open but keep forgetting to write a review. Anyways samurai sams doesn't disappoint. It's an adequate price for lunch and you are satisfied. It's not gourmet it's still fast food but a lot better and healthier options. I usually go for the regular chicken bowl. It never disappoints, its delicious.But today I tried their Asian tacos; they have this taco Tuesday special for $3. 3 tacos with chicken n veggies on top of rice with a special spicy sauce, and man was it good. And only $3, I would have paid a lot more for that.This location also serves as a Blimpie subs and another restaurant I could never remember. Very fresh food.
3	I've only gone here 3 times. Once because I had a great coupon & the other 2 because it's close to the office. I get the chicken teriyaki bowl. It's ok. Today my chicken was either over cooked or reheated too many times. Only half of the chicken was edible. The place is odd, sort of a cafeteria feel. Three restaurants in one.
1	Decided to have something different in the area...bad idea! I got the sweet and sour bowl for lunch. The chicken was dry, the vegetables were blanched with no seasoning (no flavor whatsoever), sauce had no flavor, the pineapples had no flavor or juice in them, thanks goodness for the rice otherwise I wouldn't have had lunch. Never going back!
