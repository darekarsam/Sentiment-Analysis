5	We needed flowers at the last minute for my cousin's wedding at another hotel. Marcela was so helpful - always pleasant and courteous despite on and off again changes to my request. Not only was the bouquet that I ordered beyond my expectations (and the bride's) but there was a matching boutonniere for the groom! The flowers were delivered quickly and the person who delivered them was so nice. Thank you Marcela and Pavilion Florist for going beyond your job!!!
5	I wanted a bright, colorful arrangement to brighten up my room during my last visit so I was glad there was a florist at the Rio.  This is what they designed for me.  It was beautiful, fresh, and stayed nice for several days.  It's a cute little flower shop with flowers, gifts and snacks.  I wish more hotels had florists in house.  I will definitely stop by every time I have a chance.
5	I received a surprise floral delivery last week when I arrived at my hotel.  Absolutely stunning!  Pavilion Florist used the dense, low, European style that included roses, gerbers, lilies and hydrangeas.  Even the container was beautiful, with red and black crystals in the base.  Very sophisticated presentation!  I hated to leave it when I flew back to Texas.  Highly recommend!
