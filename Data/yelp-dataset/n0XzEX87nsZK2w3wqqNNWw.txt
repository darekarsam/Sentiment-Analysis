5	If you are looking for frames, Erin at this LensCrafters location is awesome. She will help you find the perfect fit and make sure they look good too.I went in here and tried on loads of different frames. Erin was super helpful and stuck with me and kept giving me options until I found two perfect frames, one for sunglasses and one for clear lenses.This newer Boca Park location is big and has a great selection or designer frames.The service and selection here are definitely both 5 stars.
5	Great experience from the eye exam down to the assistance picking out frames and lenses. This was my first time visiting a LensCrafters. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The doctor that does the eye exams works for a separate company "Progressive Eyecare" not sure if it's like that at all LensCrafters but that's besides the point. Dr. Chen was friendly and informative. When it came to picking the frames the staff at LensCrafters was extremely helpful. I would highly recommend this location to anyone.
5	I have been going to Lenscrafters for years. The service at this new location is amazing!  The doctor was very thorough and the opticians were very helpful at selecting my new glasses. There was no pressure and I truly felt they had my best interest at heart. Great job Lenscrafters!
