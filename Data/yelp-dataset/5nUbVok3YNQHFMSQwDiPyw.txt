1	Worst haircut of my life. I literally got up and left after halfway through my haircut. I'm currently going to another salon now to see if they can fix the damage.
1	This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had trying to get a hair cut.  When I arrived my name was taken and I was told it would be a few minutes wait.  After a half hour I asked how much longer it would be.  The lady said umm and walked off never to return.  Five minutes later I walked out.  I will not be back here.  If you enjoy poor customer service than this is the place for you.
5	I have been here 4 times with a different stylist each time... I LOVE these ladies!  I have gotten great haircuts and had fun getting to know the stylists too! I am proud to be their regular customer and would suggest you give them a chance! I recommend them highly to everyone I know. I have never had to wait long and if they are busy, they are up front about the wait time. Totally professional and a hidden gem here on Yelp and in the University area of Charlotte :) They cater to all hair types too!
