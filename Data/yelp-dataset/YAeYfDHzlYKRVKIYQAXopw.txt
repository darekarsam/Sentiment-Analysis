1	On Sunday, October 21 at 4pm I arrived at the FastMed in Mesa on Val Vista and University.  I was suffering with back pain and it was difficult to stand or walk.  As I was given the paper to sign in I told Jay that I didn't have my insurance card from Aetna but my card was visible on my smartphone via Aetna's app.  He stated that wasn't valid and he would need someone to fax a copy to him.  I asked to see the supervisor and he stated that there was no supervisor.  A call to Aetna would not suffice for him either.  No card no service seemed to be his mantra.So I was turned away from medical help and had to find another facility which I did.  The front desk at another facility had no problem copying the information from my smart phone.  I was diagnosed with back spasms, treated, and given prescriptions,  At the pharmacy, the staff again had no issue using my smartphone data either.I find it unconscionable that a medical facility turned away a patient in obvious pain over a smartphone issue.  Does FastMed have such a policy?  If so, what is the difference between copying numbers from a card, from a fax, or from a smartphone. Inexcusable.  That's a mild way of evaluating your business's actions that afternoon.
1	Actually I did hear from Jason A. Williams Eastern Region Founder and CEO apologizing but nothing about addressing the shortcomings of the staff, nor any word from the actual facility itself.
1	Thanks for nothing. This will be the last time I will ever be going here! I previously visited this location because I was experiencing swollen glands. They touched my neck looked inside and called it an infection, and to buy some over the counter meds. So that's what I did, come the NEXT MORNING I had to go back because i was in so much pain I could hardly breath they finally gave me a strep test. GUESS WHAT I HAD EVERYONE? THAT'S RIGHT STREP! Why couldn't they have done that the day before? Why did I have to pay twice? This place sucks don't go!
