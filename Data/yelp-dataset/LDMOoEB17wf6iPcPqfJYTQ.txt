5	Great service.  Friendly, on-time, very honest.  I would recommend these guys.
5	All Home Appliance Service is awesome. My washer broke and someone was able to come out that day to fix it.  Tony was fabulous to work with. He educated me on how use my washer & dryer efficiently.  The cost to have the washer fixed was reasonable. I would recommend this company if you need something fixed in your home.
5	Great guy! Very professional. He was able to come out same day to fix my oven problem and l wasnt charged an arm and a leg for it. I will definitely call him again if I have any more issues with my appliances.
