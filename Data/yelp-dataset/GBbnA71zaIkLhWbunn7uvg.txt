5	Daniel is very professional and friendly. The facility was very clean and calming, and the table was warm and comfortable. He is an excellent massage therapist and really listened to what I needed and wanted from my session. The massage was amazing and my sore muscles were a million times better afterward. I will definitely go back to Daniel and highly recommend him to anyone looking for a great massage therapist.
5	Great massage therapist. He really knows what he's doing. He is flexible with my schedule and really has helped my shoulder. Highly recommended.  I like the location.
5	As an experienced customer of massage and alternative health therapies I must say that Daniel Lopes is a rare find and a jewel in his field.   If you have had a massage before and been disappointed, or if you have not had the success you wanted with other massage therapists, I recommend to give Daniel's services a go and experience the healing difference that comes from a naturally gifted massage therapist who has also dedicated the extra time and effort needed in order to truly understand his craft.  As a guy, I was a bit undecided about receiving a massage from another guy, and had only been worked on by females prior to working with Daniel. Daniel was very kind and listened well to my suggestions, working with me rather than just "on me".  He was very professional in his manner and conduct, and I never felt weird at any moment.   The massage room is set up nicely and very comfortable, and he diffuses essential oils and has soft massage music playing.Although I leave every massage with Daniel feeling extremely relaxed, I believe the real results are seen the next day when I really begin to feel the lasting difference in my muscles and reduced pain levels.  Thanks Daniel!!
