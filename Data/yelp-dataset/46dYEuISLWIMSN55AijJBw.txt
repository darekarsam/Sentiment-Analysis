5	Just watch where you pick up your produce.
5	One of the few things that I miss about Pittsburgh after relocating is Giant Eagle. The chain stores in Chicago, Jewel and Dominicks, cannot hold a candle to the Big Ig. This one in particular has a great selection, new products in stock before anybody else, low prices, and the wonderful incentive of saving gas money through GetGo.I miss the Dirty Bird.
4	Fresh produce and helpfull staff !!
5	This will probably be our back-up Giant Eagle. They have a great seafood counter and produce section also.
3	Busy, confusing, crazy parking lot.
3	This location needs an update.  By that I mean they need to put in some of those self check out registers.  I was hoping to make a quick trip in here and be on my way, but that was a failure.Aside from that, it was an OK experience with having just about everything I needed.
3	The store was clean, the workers were friendly.  Nice parking lot, lots of sales. Definitely not a place to go if you want healthy, GMO free & organic food. They don't have much of a selection & the selection they do have is way over priced. You can go and buy monthly T passes, which is very convenient and nice.
