1	The good-Clean store, well stockedThe bad-Horrible service, NEVER enough cashiers and the self check outs rarely work well.  Always tired at the end of the day.  The last thing I want to do is stand for 15 minutes waiting to buy a quick dinner.
1	This place sucks for customer service. Their organic selection is NON EXISTENT! the store closes at midnight I tried to come in at 1145pm one night and they denied me. Lines are always backed up. Avoid this place.
3	Prices are average and many are high. Service is rude to good. I shopped a few times and was thoroughly unimpressed. If I do go there it is for one or two things.  Some times powdered drink, fresh flowers or fresh corn on sale. At $.15 cents an ear I strip and freeze.
