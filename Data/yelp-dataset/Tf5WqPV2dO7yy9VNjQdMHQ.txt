The beer selection had newcastle which is always top choice of mine. The burgers looked really good. The poutine with pulled pork was ultimately our choice. It was good but not great. I believe that the pork wasn't seasoned well enough. ( I do like a lot of salt though.) The gravy also could've been spiced up a little. All in all the place wasn't bad and I would definitely check it out again. The good - the bread and spice rub.The bad - the pork which was cooked to perfection just lacked seasoning.
