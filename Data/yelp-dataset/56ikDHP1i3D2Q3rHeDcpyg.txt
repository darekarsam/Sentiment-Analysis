5	A little beer shop packed with local beers and charcuterie.Open 11 to 11 every day and friendly and helpful staff.  It's pretty much everything I want in a Beer store.
5	The shop is small but the owner does an excellent job in selecting only the best products . They will also be happy to help you choose beers to your palate .
