4	Went to Kimbob cafe  today March 13, 2013, it was a pleasant surprise. Kimbob is located on a small strip on mall on the North side of the 20, you can see the sign from the highway. We have passed by this place many times and it was always closed as they only served breakfast and lunch and closed at 3.00PM, so we never got a chance to try this place. Two weeks ago the decided to open for supper and it it a good thing for the west island.I had some kimchee it was good and marinated not the fresh kind some places serve. We had Bibim Bab  and Jabche both were extremely tasty. This is a family run business so you know its going to be authentic with a Korean cook. Their home made chili sauce is also very tasty. If you are not sure what you want ask KC, he is very helpful and will guide you through the menu.I like it, in fact I like it very much and will be going back quite often. Please go and support this lovely little gem in Dorval, I'd like to keep this to myself, but west islanders need a good tasty Korean restaurant and this is definitely one to share.-------I have been back to Kimbob cafe over a dozen times and have covered the menu and I am starting all over again. Great food.
