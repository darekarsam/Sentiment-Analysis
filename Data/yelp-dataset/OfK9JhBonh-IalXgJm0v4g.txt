5	If you want your car looking brand new, take it to Gentry!  This was the best experience I have ever had with auto body repair.  Gentry walked me through everything they would need to do to fix my car door and gave me the best and worst scenarios.  Luckily they were able to fix it under the best scenario, but he was extremely courteous, respectful, and really knew what he was talking about.  Great job!!!
5	This place is fantastic!  I got rear-ended on a Sunday, took my car in to Gerber on Tuesday and got it back Friday morning.  Car was spick and span.  Kim was a great and informative contact!
5	I took my Nissan Murano to Gerbers after a freeway accident had damaged the side of my vehicle. They did an amazing job- my vehicle looked better than brand new. In addition, the office called daily to keep me updated on the progress. Excellent customer service & I highly recommend this place. Great workmanship.
5	Very happy with this place. They fixed my truck when it was rear ended, and things were done quickly. I realized after I got home that they had even cleaned up one of my headlights which had been yellow and hazy, even though it had absolutely nothing to do with the accident that they repaired for me.
