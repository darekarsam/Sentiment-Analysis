3	Pretty much like most urban McDonald's. Decent service, the food just as you expect it. I just got a cheeseburger and the $1 large sweet tea to get out of the heat and work on my computer.The store wasn't the cleanest when I was there. WiFi was very fast but outlets hard to find.
2	I'm not the best person to ask an opinion about when it comes to McDonalds. In fact I hate it. I quit eating it about ten years ago, that is until someone decided that after they took my order for Burger King and they weren't open that they would run here to get food. LAME.I wasn't going to be fussy and have a tantrum like a little kid, so I caved and let them bring me food from here. I can guarantee that I ate it like a two year old kid. I picked at it, played with it, complained about it, and if I could have, I would have fed it to a dog. However, I view that as animal cruelty.I give them kudos for attempting to be festive and mix the grease with leafy greens, but it still comes down to that nasty grease they fry everything in.  That's all my tongue sensed. I hated the food and then myself later that night as I made many trips to the bathroom, cursing each time. Remember, beggars can't be chooser. So when it comes to McDonalds, panhandle elsewhere.
2	It is a McDonald's in the middle of Oakland. It is a fast food chain and they are usually busy. The only good thing is that they are open 24 hours so you can always get your late night greasy snack! I had a coupon, so I went there. I wouldn't pick it for an every day meal.
