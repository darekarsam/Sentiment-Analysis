1	I have my go 2 spot for hair cuts. Being that this place was new I wanted to give it a try but unfortunately I couldn't.I walked in this places was seemingly busy, there were at least 4 people sitting waiting to be tended to. I asked her how much was the hair cut for my daughter and my self. Now bear in mind that Natalie is only 3 and her hair is shoulder length.I already knew what the prices were because they are listed on the front door. The woman decided to contradict those prices by saying that Natalie is not a child so she would cost $12.00 instead of $9.00 On the door or store front is says children $9.00. The last time I checked Natalie is a child/kid/ toddler.Oh no, according to this woman Natalie is not a child, kid or toddler. Therefore she doesn't qualify for the $9.00 haircut.At this point in time I decided to take my daughter to another place. I get very peevish around people who are hypocritesThe business remains nascent and not very promising so far.
5	Rosy is amazing! I have been searching all over Las Vegas for someone that can cut Asian hair and Finally!!! She is so good I almost did not want to share in fear I might not get an appointment, but I have to share the love to my girls. If you are looking for someone who can not only cut hair, but can style, ask for Rosy.
