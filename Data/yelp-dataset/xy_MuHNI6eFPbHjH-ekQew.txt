4	Good McDonalds
1	They're dirty, most of their employees are just terrible and rude, and their time management sucks. The girl who took our order through the drive through tonight was high, rude, and we were sitting there waiting for our 2 Big Macs and 3 hamburgers for closer to 25 minutes, and that's not even my worst experience there.I should have asked for my money back and left, but she was so unbelievably beyond high, she probably would have had no idea what I was even saying. Needless to say, I will never go back to that McDonald's, or any McDonald's, and neither will my family. I will be sure to let my friends know about my multiple horrible experiences there, too.
5	I'm loving it.Inexpensive foodsPlay Place is pretty coolSeparated area for business people Free wifi Correct order every time I have gone hereNever had an issue with any of the staff
