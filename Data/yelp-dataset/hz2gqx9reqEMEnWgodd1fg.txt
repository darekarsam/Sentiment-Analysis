5	We needed a piano delivered and the prices were outrages! Dave and his crew quoted us an amazing price and delivered it very fast. Our antique piano was in very good hands they were professional and knew exactly how to transport it without damaging it. If you looking for a quick, reliable, professional, hardworking delivery team I would HIGHLY recommend Las Vegas Deliveries. Now I just need to learn how to play the piano :) Thanks for the great service. The McDuffie's

Thank you Dave!!! I'll definitely be using you again in the future
