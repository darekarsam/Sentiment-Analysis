5	Bought a gift for my wife over Christmas for a set of eyelash extensions and she fell in love with Joanna. She now goes to her for facials and surprised me with permanent makeup. I was very hesitant in accepting the permanent makeup, but once it healed it looks amazing! As a matter of fact I have also met joanna and now I go to her for my back wax. 2 thumbs up, 5 stars!!
5	Joanna is terrific!  A true professional,  she is highly skilled,  talented and proficient.  She maintains high standards of cleanliness and is attentive to the little things, always ensuring a great outcome.  Once you have an established a relationship,  she will do whatever is necessary (within reason) to find time on her busy schedule and accommodate your needs. When you respect her as the professional she is (very easy to do), she responds with respect for you,  her client. In addition,  she is simply a nice person.  My first visit was a discount through Amazon Local.  The service and manner with which she treated me was not discounted!  I felt like the most important and beautiful woman in the world. I highly recommend Joanna, a true artist at her craft--making you as beautiful as is possible. Try Skinductive.  You'll love the experience, and Joanna!
