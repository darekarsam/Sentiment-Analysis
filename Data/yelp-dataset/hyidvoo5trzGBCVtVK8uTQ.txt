4	I will be honest, I am always cautious about what service people will charge. They know that some people won't question how much they charge. I am not one of those people. I had Blue Marlin come out to look at my pool. The pump was leaking. Derek was on time, very friendly. He checked the whole pump, replaced the PVC Pipes and fittings. He also tested everything. They charged a very reasonable price.
5	I have zero knowledge of pools, but since I just bought a home with a pool, I called Blue Marlin to ask about a run through on my pool system. Derek came out and was very personable and easy going. Super informative and showed me everything I needed to know. Helped find a clog in my pump. Will call these guys for every pool question!
5	This is a great pool Service, always on time and do a great job for less money than our previous service charged.  They also monitor our equipment and make recommendations for service, detect leaks, etc. Marty and his staff are always friendly and helpful. We had an occasion a few years ago,where we purchased a new remote operating system for our pool. It did not work as well as we all would have liked. Nearly two years after the purchase, Marty called one day and said that they would be bringing out a whole new system at no charge to us as HE was not happy with the system that they had sold us. That to me is not only great service but a true business partnership.
