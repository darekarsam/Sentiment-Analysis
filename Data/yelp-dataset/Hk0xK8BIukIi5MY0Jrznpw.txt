3	Decided to check out the new location for some Christmas shopping. The store is well-lit and well-laid out. The staff were very helpful when we approached them, but not all over us as we perused. Most of the major brands you would expect to find at a skateshop were there - and in Montreal that's saying something.With only two cashes, however, we stood in line at least fifteen minutes before being able to pay for our purchases.My main suggestion to the owners would be a little more sitting space - if you've come in off the street and have been shopping all day, sitting down is likely to extend my stay in your store and help you part me from the contents of my wallet.
4	Heather's review bellow mine is telling. This is like the Wallmart of skating. Back to school style. And thats not a slam on the shop.... The place is just HUGE. They have everything from every big brand all merchandised perfectly. LOVE all the shoes. Its really a trip to walk around in being used to small to hole in the wall sized shops. Staff was friendly. great selection of hardware in addition to soft goods. My last trip to Montreal was 10 years ago and I hit up Underworld forging for gear at its old location. How the time passes. Good to see them still around.
