1	Sunset shutters gets zero stars. This place is bullshit. Ordered and paid for custom shutters in December. It's April and still no effing shutters. They have made several appointments to install, but have stood us up. Unprofessional, inconsiderate. Cannot recommend. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY...bastards...We dealt with a person named Alvaro Ramirez....our attorneys will handle from here...
5	For shutters, quality and service best price!!! he did our hole shutters work in my scottsdale vacation home.
5	I have used Sunset Shutters for my clients and everyone has been extremely happy with the results.  Their products are exceptional and their client service has also been excellent.  They have delivered on time and their installations have been very professional.  I would not hesitate to recommend them.
1	Do not use sunset shutters! They are criminals, we have given them over $5000 for a clients job and he will not return our phone calls! Do not make the same mistake
5	I got referred to sunset shutters by me next door neighbor who could not stopped telling me how pleased they were from the price, service and final product. I had them quote my new house in windgate ranch and they were a bit lower then the other 2 estimates I received from competitive shutter companies. I decided to go with sunset shutters and was very pleased from start to finish. I would highly recommend them to anyone for both quality shutters and conventional window coverings.
