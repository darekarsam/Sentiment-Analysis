4	We order pizza from them last night, and hats off to the cook!!  The bread sticks were fresh and hot, and the pizzas were great too!
3	We had a decent dinner from there last night but it was greasy and we ordered a full order of regular breadsticks and got half cinnamon
1	This is the worst Pizza Hut that I have ever ordered from. The pizza was cold and the sauce was nasty. The crust tasted like it had been sitting for days. The wings were sitting in pool of sauce and grease and the bone was red like it had been sitting in blood before it was cooked for a while. It was so nasty that I could not eat it because I thought I was going to get sick. I called the manager and her best idea was she could come and pick it up and reimburse me but it would be another hour or make me more. I will never order from there again and hope they get shut down.
1	This is the worst pizza store in Charlotte. I have ordered from this location three times and they have never gotten my order correct. Ever. As the other reviewers noted the management is horrible and rude. Don't waste your money.
1	This place is awful dont waste your money go somewhere else. delivery took almost two hours and pizza was cold. Not to mention my order was wrong. I used to work here many years ago i hate to see this franchise go down the toilet. DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!!!!!!!
1	I only rated 1 star because I couldn't select a half or none.  Placed a delivery order at 5:30 and was told 30 minutes.  Called at 6:50 am was told it was on its way.  Called back again at 7:15 and it was not in the system anywhere and they have no record of it (after taking our credit card mind you).  Will never order from there again and suggest you use caution as well, especially if you have young kids.
1	ordered online, then an hour later they said it was going to take an additional hour.  Ruined our panthers football game!!  Never ordering from pizza hut again.
