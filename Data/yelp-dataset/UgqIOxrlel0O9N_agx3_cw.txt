4	Went into see Dr. Kiernan for the first time in several years last week.  She has an office located inside the Wal-mart shopping center.  Dr. Kiernan has been my family's vision specialist for almost eight years and has always been fantastic.One great thing about Dr. Kiernan is her office; it has a separate door on the outside of the Wal-mart vision center.  This is great for those that don't want to deal with the chaos inside Wally world.  Overall, my appointment was splendid and I got my new contact prescription in little time  I will definitely see Dr. Kiernan next year.
5	Dr. Kiernan is excellent. She is the best eye doctor ever!!! Very knowledgeable and extremely helpful.
5	Dr Kiernan and her staff are phenomenal. I've been seeing her (no pun intended, of course) for several years now and have had nothing but fantastic experiences.She is very professional, super nice and very thorough. Makes going to the eye doctor a very pleasant experience and I appreciate it.
1	glutton for punishment, i am not. accurate documentation of prescription- fail. communication with 1-800-contacts & fill of script- fail.
4	I haven't been here since 2010. Everyone in the office was pleasant and patient. They were so good, I didn't even notice I was there an hour. To be clear, I was there for an hour because of me, I needed more testing done. On that note, they didn't let me leave until they thoroughly tested me properly. My eyes weren't doing so well this time and they took the time to make sure I didn't need to be referred to a specialist. It's unusual in my experience to have everyone in a "Doctor office setting" to be in sync. The staff was exceptionally kind and knew what they were doing. My Eye doctor Dr. Wells made it a pleasant experience for me.... Even when she had to look under my eye lids! I appreciate when a doctor visit is personal and I feel like I actually have a name.  Great eye appointment! I would highly recommend this Optometrist facility!carla
