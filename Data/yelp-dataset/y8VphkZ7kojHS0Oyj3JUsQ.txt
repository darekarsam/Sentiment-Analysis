4	I'm new to the area and pass this salon all the time so I figured I would try it out. I had a cut and blow dry and had a great experience. Hannah cut my hair and did an awesome job. I love the Aveda products they use and it was really inexpensive. I will definitely be returning.
5	I was a first time customer and I was impressed with the customer service from the moment I walked in. The salon was clean and trendy, the receptionist made a fresh cup of coffee for me, and all staff were very welcoming. Hannah did a great job with my haircut and my blowout looked phenomenal! I liked the salon so much I scheduled another appointment with her. I definitely recommend this place for those who are hesitant to try new salons, they do a great job.
