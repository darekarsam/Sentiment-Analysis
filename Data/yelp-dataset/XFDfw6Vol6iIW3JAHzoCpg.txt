5	Great service.  I called them after a search on the internet.  Very reasonably priced, delivered on time, and looked great!Definitely recommend, and I will use again
4	I called them to order some flowers for delivery to my girlfriend.  They had the flowers that I wanted and could deliver them where I wanted.  I ordered them at about 8:30am to be delivered to her apartment.  While going through what I wanted on the card and the delivery information, the person taking my order was very slow and deliberate taking down the info, which is better than making a mistake, but a little painstaking, still.Not wanting to ruin the surprise for my girlfriend, I didn't mention it to her until she texted me at about 6:30pm asking if I had ordered her flowers because a florist had called her to set up the delivery.  They then soon delivered a beautiful bouquet to her, exactly as I ordered (actually two more flowers, but for the price I was quoted, which is nice).  I just don't know why they waited so long to deliver them.  My only guess is that they waited until after normal office hours so that there was a better likelihood that she would be home, which makes sense, but I just wish I had known that first.Overall, great service, great flowers, and beautiful arrangement, but I just wish I could have known beforehand that it would have take them so long to get delivered.  I will definitely use them again.
