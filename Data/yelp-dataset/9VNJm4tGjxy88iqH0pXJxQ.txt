5	Liz is the BOMB! :) No one is allowed to touch my hair except this gorgeous hair goddess; I will make the extra drive every time to see her and over half a decade later, she's still my one and only! She is simply AH-MAH-ZING!
5	Call 2 weeks in advance (at least)! Great staff, fun environment, inviting atmosphere, and most important- GREAT hair afterwards!!!
5	I have been getting my hair cut & colored by Mia for years.  She is the most cheerful down to earth person you'll ever meet.  I am picky when it comes new color or cuts, but the next day after seeing her I am always ecstatic how awesome my hair looks and feels after trying something new.

5	Joanne is the BEST ! She has been doing my families hair for 6 years and we all love her.  People ask me "who does your hair" all the time and I am always happy to recomend Joanne, I followed her from Mane Attraction to Inizio Salon and I see many familiar faces when I go there-guess I wasn't the only one to follow Joanne Sher!!
5	Joanne Sher is absolutely the best. Always a great experience. She always keeps me looking handsome :) absolutely the best in the business. :) I'll never let anyone else style my hair. Joanne is absolutely the best!!!
5	Angela Colson is the absolute best!!! Every time I go in I ask for a new look and she does exactly what I envision and then some!

She makes all her clients feel comfortable and has real conversations with them! You won't regret going to her!
