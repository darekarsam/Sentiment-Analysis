3	I have a sweet spot for Gameday. Half of the obnoxious orange stuff I own comes from here, and they always have a good selection of...well, orange stuff. I gravitate towards the basketball section - this year's Nike warm-ups, jerseys, t-shirts, etc, etc. I don't know if it's my imagination or what, but sometimes I think Gameday is a little more expensive than some other places, although on a recent trip, I don't think that was the case.I think they do custom stuff - maybe silk screen your name on a blank jersey, that sort of thing, and they have a wide range of other random Illinois chotchke, but this is what I have to go every time I'm in Champaign, just to make sure there's nothing I can't do without.
3	They have a good selection, but wow is this stuff expensive.  It pains me to buy $45 sweatshirts, but I guess that's not uncommon for college attire shops.  They were open until 9 pm on a Friday night (homecoming weekend) which was much appreciated, since I needed a long sleeved Illini shirt to wear under my hoodie.  We were going to start tailgating around 7 am, and it was about 40 degrees outside.  I needed another warm layer of Illini-awesomeness to shield me from the cold until the beer kicked in.  Done and done.  They have fitting rooms, which is good.  Not much else to say!
5	Can't go wrong with their buy one, get one free t-shirt section! Always a lot to choose from and a great atmosphere in the heart of campus.
