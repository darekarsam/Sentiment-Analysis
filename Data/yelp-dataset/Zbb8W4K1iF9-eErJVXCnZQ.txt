5	The bartender at poppys place is the best.... He drinks more than the customers. Cheap drinks, happy hour all day, food to go and the bar never closes. The owners wife is a little off her rocker but other than that this place is the shit.
5	A very wonderful establishment.  Had a great time there my drink was never empty and the owner was a joy to speak with.   I found the owners wife to be a fine woman who seemed to be pretty right on her rocker.   The menu was fantastic with choices of salad, pasta, chicken and beef.  Would highly recommend to everyone who's in the neighborhood.
5	Some place warm. A place where the beer flows like wine. Where beautiful women instinctively flock like the salmon of Capistrano. I'm talkin about a little place called Poppys.
5	Fun place to go....Poppy himself is usually behind the bar serving a constant flow of fun and beverages.  You're likely to find his bride there also, entertaining patrons with her groovy dance moves and quick wit, served with a splash of sarcasm!  Not sure of the hours, but it seems like It's always open.  Happy Hour-- 3 for 1.  Poolside service available.  Definately a must-see while in Arizona!J&A Frillici
