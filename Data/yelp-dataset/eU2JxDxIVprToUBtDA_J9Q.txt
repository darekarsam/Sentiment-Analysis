5	I drop off my husband every morning, and I like to grab a coffee and a quick bite. I had a bad experience at the circle k right up the road from this.QT and that place was disgusting. As.soon as I walk in I notice the cleanliness. So important since I am.buying food n my coffee. A young lady who was cleaning the floors was so friendly. When I complemented on how.clean they are. She thanked me and.the gentlemen.at the register was a so.alive. for.me.being so draggy in the morning,He just pepped me up with awesome customer service. I will become a regular on my trip to drop off my husband.
