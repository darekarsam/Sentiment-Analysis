5	Had called a big Phoenix company that always advertises on TV.  Quote to replace the A/C ECM motor was $1650 - $1900.  Talon (Mike) responded this morning to my call and fixed the problem within 5 hours of call.  That included picking up motor.  Price was fair and well below the "big" other company.  I won't say what my final cost was, but the "other" company tried talking me into a whole new HVAC unit for $9000 or fix what I have - again - for $1900.  My unit was just over 7 years old.  Glad I said no and got recommendations that led me to Talon Air.  I saved some serious money and had it done very quickly.  Glad I spent the time to find Talon.
5	My A.C unit was running constantly and couldn't keep my house under 80 degrees.  I called Talon Air and had Mike come check it out, he found that when my unit was installed the company ran the unit open to the attic and it sucked insulation into it.  Mike cleaned it out and had our unit running like brand new!
5	I have used Mike (Owner of Talon Air) on my last few A/C issues.  He's always fast and reliable.  He gets there when he says he's going to, and his prices are super reasonable.  I have never had to wait longer than a day, and he always gets the job done quickly, and with as little inconvenience as possible.  I cannot recommend Talon Air highly enough.
