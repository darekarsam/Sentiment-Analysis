2	What can I say... I am a bargain shopper! I'm not cheap, but I get more satisfaction out of getting a bargain than I do spending a ton of money for a name brand item at Nordstrom or Sax Fifth. That being said, sure you can find a pair of shoes you'll like here, but the selection is simply OK, and its usually full retail price. Most of the time they have a two-for-one deal or get the second pair half price. Still, its never really any kind of sweet deal.
2	Just like another shoe place I reviewed, it's a hit or miss. This time it was a big miss. I found absolutely nothing.  Yuck
3	I've been to a lot of Famous Footwear stores and this one is no different. There is usually only one employee working and on the rare occasion, two employees. Not that you ever really need more than one, but just in case. The standard greeting is issued upon walking into the store and help is offered if you linger long enough. I usually beeline it for the clearance rack, as those are some of the best deals. Ten bucks for a pair of flats is a pretty good deal, especially if they are comfortable. I've also got some great boots and sandals from the clearance section. If I bring my husband along, he wanders the men's section but can't always find shoes that are comfortable. Overall, this is my go-to place for shoes (other than the internet, of course!).
