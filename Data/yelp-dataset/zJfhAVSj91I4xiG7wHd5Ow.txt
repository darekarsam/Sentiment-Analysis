5	Not only is Eliza so talented at what she does but she is also an amazing person. She gave me such a cute hair cut and also helped me with something I was going through at the time. She gave me such great advice I feel like I should have paid double for a counseling session!! But really, this isn't the first time I've gone to her for a hair cut. I trust her complicity with my hair and always will. Her eye for style is unmatched. She's so great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5	Visited the Canvas on 9/12 for a peel after having bought a Groupon for $29. I trained as an esthetician, so I am SUPER picky about my skin. Gail, the esthetician at Canvas looked at my skin and read my client intake form and then customized the peel to suit what I had asked for I wanted my skin to be brighter, I had that "after summer" dull dry top layer). During the treatment, I got a hand and arm massage with some delicious lemongrass lotion (had to buy it), extractions and finished off with some very delicious lip balm. The treatment lasted around an hour, which was excellent value for money and my skin looked great!! Still does! A hidden gem in Fort Mill!!
1	If I could give no stars I would. Danielle was horrible.  Did not listen one bit to what I asked for.  I came out looking worse than when I showed up to get my hair done.  If I could take my tip back I would!  Will never come back to this so called salon again.  The worst!
