5	WOW WOW . . . I just had the Seared Ahi Tuna wrap and it was HUGE!!!!!! It was light and flavorful perfectly matched with very fresh vegetables.
5	Great food and friendly service.  Try the hippie style oatmeal as a twist to the morning
5	I have only eaten there 3 times, but the three different sandwiches i ate were DELICIOUS!  The cookies are amazing, if not finite in amount, and huge!  Definitely becoming a regular!  The fact that they have a Telluride location is just icing on the cake!
5	It's surprising how hard it is to actually find a well-made sandwich. This was delicious. Caprese Sandwich - YUM.Italian Chicken Sandwich  - YUM.Potato salad - YUM.I heard about this "new place right up the street" and am so glad I gave it a shot for lunch today. They're family run, and this is their second location. The first is in Telluride and currently run by the owner's son. I learned this while chatting with him at the counter while his daughter, the chef, made my sandwich. I love local businesses and am so happy to support them. Best of luck!
5	Original breakfast sandwich with bacon was Really good! Great ciabatta roll. Jerry the owner is very personable. Will be back.
5	I support local businesses and this place is a great little coffee/sandwich/salad shop. It's a father/daughter run team and they are very friendly and pleasant people. I've been in several times and haven't tried anything I didn't like. Their cookies are amazing! Atmosphere is cozy and there is a great outdoor patio area as well. You won't be disappointed.
5	Fantastic sandwich and even better potato salad if you're in the area you need to check this place out!
5	Wow!  This hidden gem of a deli is fantastic!  I went for lunch and was not disappointed!  Sandwich was wonderful. Really no complaints..if i had any suggestions it would be a bigger serving of side coleslaw. Affordable, friendly, and fast too!  Cant wait to go back!
