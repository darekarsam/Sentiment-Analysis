4	Ooo-wee! This food truck came by my job for lunch so I'm a tad biased due to convenience! And I'm from Lexington, NC area so bah-buh-cue is my thang! As chopped BBQ "sammiches" go this one is pretty good!! The sauce is sweet like I like it and it was refreshing to have Mac and cheese that wasn't kraft! Give them a try!You're welcome.
5	BBQ sundae, get it!  If you're lucky to visit when he has dessert, try that too, it's all great!Recently added smoked turkey is definitely worth a try also, or just add it to your BBQ sundae.
5	If you see this truck you must stop!  I have had everything and it's all so good. George is one of the friendliest people I have ever met. Top notch.
