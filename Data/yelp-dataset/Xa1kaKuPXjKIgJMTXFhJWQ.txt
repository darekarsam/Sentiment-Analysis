4	After multiple visits to this location, I can say that they are above average in their customer service. Staff turnover seems to be high, but I guess most fast food places have the same problem. Never had a problem with food quality or noticed any cleanliness issues when dining inside. Drive thru usually moves quickly.
3	Quick service, fresh food, just wish that they had the A&W back. The A&W on tap and cheese curds here were fantastic. Oh well, whats done is done.
3	As far as fast food chicken places, it's ok, nothing spectacular.  I wasn't impressed with the chicken sandwich I got, in fact I don't remember the name of it.  It would have been better had it been a chicken patty instead of a strip and if they had actually done more than shown the bun the special sauce. The best part, are the reusable containers the coleslaw comes in.
1	I went thru drive thru tonight and was absolutely disgusted at what I saw. While we were waiting at window to pay and get food, the guy getting our drinks filled up our cups using the ice that was sitting in the catch-all tray under the fountain machine. I could not believe my eyes.  When the other guy came to window to collect money I immediately said I am not taking those drinks because he just filled up the cups with ice from the nasty tray under the fountain machine. All he said was "ok" with a shit grin on his face.  I told him he was gonna give me 3 empty cups and i would go inside to fill myself. He said he would give to me when I came inside. I said you will give them to me now, which he did. Then of course, I got home and realized I paid with cash and he so conveniently forgot to give me my receipt. So here I am signing up for my first yelp review.  I will never eat here again!
