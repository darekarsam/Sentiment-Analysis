3	They do pretty good work but aren't negotiable to do extra work on the side when insurance is paying. They make promises and don't keep them and are all about the money and no customer service
3	We had many issues with finding the correct door for my vehicle. We were a cash paying customer and were quoted an amount, but they called us back later, once our vehicle was already there, to tell us that our door is discontinued and that they'd have to find one, so it would cost more than initially stated. THEN, we were called and the company that they got the door from, had sent them the wrong door. Of course the door that was needed was going to cost even more. I don't understand body collision shops to be honest, but I would think that somehow they would have wanted the customer satisfaction? they could have eaten the cost once they realized that they screwed up? we were told that there was going to be no breaks in the cost, because the laborers were the ones suffering. I don't quite understand that logic because they'd be doing the same amount of labor regardless of what door it was being replaced, no? but like I said, I don't fully understand.Boooo to the company who sent the wrong door, I guess.My vehicle is fixed and the job is satisfactory, except for one teeny thing-my back door squeaks when its being opened and closed. Does not affect the looks or function of the door, just a minor annoyance that did not occur before it was in the shop.*quote was better than other shops in the same area
5	Excellent work and had my car back the day it was promised!!! The shop was clean and employees were friendly. Most shops seem sleepy and dirty. The main thing I liked was the customer service and good work!
