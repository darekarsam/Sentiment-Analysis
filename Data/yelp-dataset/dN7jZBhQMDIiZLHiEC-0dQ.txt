2	Very surprised this hasn't been reviewed before.  I went to this place one time.  I ordered one of the specials and asked for it cooked medium well - it arrived undercooked dramatically.  I had it returned and it came back still undercooked and kind of disgusting.  To be fair I might not have ordered the right thing for a restaurant in a strip mall.  But it was one of the daily specials!  Girlfriend had a pasta dish that was ok.  There are better options for italian food but not many in the nearby area.
2	My wife and I were anxious to try this place. Big letdown. Overpriced, and not that great... Borderline bad.Try at your own risk. If your expecting anything authentic and good, go elsewhere. Try Giacomo's Italian Restaurant on E. Mallard Creek Rd.  Look them up...
1	Another low point in this gastronomic wasteland AKA North Carolina.Shrimp Parmesan North Carolina style apparently means a small shrimp buried inside a hush puppy.  It's no wonder this is a chain restaurant haven, the local offerings provide no alternative.
