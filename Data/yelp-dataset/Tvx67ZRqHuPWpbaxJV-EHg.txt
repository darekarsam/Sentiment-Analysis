5	I first came to Dewain, owner,  for his service a while back and this review is overdued. I seek his tint service when he was first opening his doors so he was able to go above and beyond on my car. The car that was worked on had caked on tint from the car's pervious owner and Dewain offered a free removal if I did a complete tint knowing how bad it was. Which I did. He even went out of his way to have him and his staff pick up the vehicle. So I never had to leave the house. Probably because he was still in a Grand Opening he had the availability and it was much appreciated. The tint itself came out great. And the price just can't be beat. Any competition watch out.

He is beyond good, great prices and genuinely cares about customer satisfaction! He's the best in town, and has the best prices. Hands down Number 1! Love his work! Thx Dwayne!
