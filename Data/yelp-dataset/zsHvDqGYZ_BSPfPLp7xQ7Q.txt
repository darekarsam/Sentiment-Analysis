5	Officially my favorite record store in Charlotte!  They have a great quanity and  variety of different types of used records.  They also have four turntables with headphones for you to listen to your albums before purchase.  I found the Big Chill soundtrack here for only 3.50 cents, and this is the place that I found out about my favorite hip-hop groups appearence in Charlotte.  While I browsed the store's selection a DJ spun Justice and Chromeo in the back of the store in front of graf-art, amidst a slew of wax-heads drinking Millers.  The selection ranges from dance music to hip hop to even Motown.  I could have stayed here all day, but I thought that would have been rude.
3	Central Records has a good selection of used records and CDs. It's definitely a place to check out if you're into vinyl. Overall, though, it has a weird vibe. I'm not a fan of the cats that live there (though, yes, I'll acknowledge it's nice that they took in cats who needed a home).
