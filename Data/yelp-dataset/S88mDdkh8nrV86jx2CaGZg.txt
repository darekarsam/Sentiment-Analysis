5	Absolutely THE best place to eat in the West Island.  Mouthwatering salads, fabulous pizza, amazing grilled chicken & pasta dishes... all made with the freshest local ingredients and served to you by friendly & courteous staff. In the summer, the terrace is an oasis nestled beneath a vine-covered pergola where you can enjoy the waterfront ambiance while sipping Sangria and enjoying a leisurely meal.  If you have not tried this place yet, you're really missing out!!
