4	The service at this Barros is great. We have always gotten our food real fast and it is always fresh. The Barros special pizza is the best. The wings are always great. They have TVs going to keep you entertained. I also like how they have a separate kids area so there are not tons of rugrats running around. They also have awesome lunch specials where you can get pizza by the slice and a drink for super cheap.
5	The family and I love this place. The pizza is fantastic, they load on the toppings. Definitely try the Chicken Supreme. You won't be disappointed.  My kids really enjoy playing and eating in the kids area and devour the pizza. The price is very reasonable and even more so when considering all the food you get. I highly recommend Barro's Pizza.
5	Love the pizza.
5	I just ordered Barro's tonight for dinner---an order of breadsticks and Kona pizza.  I was told it would be 45 min delivered, and it came in about 30.  The delivery guy was super nice, and the pizza was hot and delish!  I'd always had candian bacon with pineapple, but the chicken was very good :)  I love the deep dish Chicago style, and I will definitely be ordering again!!
4	Had the mega meat pizza... It was pretty good. Usually take my kids here as it has a play area.
5	The pizza here is to die for.. The service was above and beyond... Our server Nakeya was the best...
