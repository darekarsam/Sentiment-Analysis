5	In the first time, I had a new experience with classic mani. They did more carefully. Before starting, they asked me the detail of what I expected. It was not the same to other salon. They also take their time to ensure I was absolutely satisfied. I found a bit mistake and required to fix it, They did it with enthusiastically. Highly recommed and definitely be back!
5	Great service. Make reservations, they do take walk ins but they are so popular you may wait. Worth it though!
5	Great service, very friendly and reasonable prices. I've been here 3 times and they are consistently great.
2	Not happy! My nails are yellowing after 2 days. Called to see if they could refund since I was from out of town. They took my name and number and never called back. I spent 180 on my mom and mine pedi/mani ..they should of tried to rectify the problem.
5	Love this place! Great service! Very fried my and personable. Did a great job on my nails!
5	I stumbled upon Shayna Nails 3 years ago when i first moved to Arizona and i was so satisfied with the services and friendly staff that i never left. They offer Gift Cards for the holidays and the prices are very reasonable. I would definately recommend this place for anyone new to the Ahwatukee or Chandler area.
