4	More of a Golden Triangle "view", you see how and where the three rivers come come together. Good view for the 496 fireworks displays that happen during the summer.
5	I learned about this place from DH while we started dating.   He had dared to show me something beautiful about Pittsburgh that I had never seen before on our second date.  I didn't think it was possible since he wasn't a Pittsburgh native.  Apparently most Pittsburgh natives don't know about this place - how sad!  I was blow away by the view.  In my opinion it's much better than Mount Washington, and it's now a place we regularly take our guests to see.
