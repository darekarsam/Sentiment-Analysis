5	SIMPLY THE BEST!    Had Lunch Express cater an office party and they did a top notch job!  The food was just wonderful and the presentation was much better than what you would think a simple little lunch-stop would do.  The are NOT just a "Lunch Express" go-to place, but also breakfast!  Joe really cares and is wonderful at what he does. If you haven't tried this place--please DO!  Bravo and Thanks!
3	Since when is the main ingredient in pesto, mayonnaise. I hate mayonnaise. If I want mayo I'd have asked for it. It should be labeled pesto mayo, not pesto. Anyway, decent food and they deliver.
