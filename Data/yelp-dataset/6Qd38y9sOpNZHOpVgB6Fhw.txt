5	Hickory Grove is the church where I vote and where my daughter plays soccer. My church, http://www.BranchChurch.org is in a rented facility and has no place to do baptisms. HG let us use their facility on a Friday night complete with sound guys... I think that's really cool!
4	I went here with some friends for Easter service. I liked the church, I would have given it 5 stars but the service is in a huge gymnasium style worship area and I grew up going to the more traditional church building - other than that it was great - people were friendly and they offer alot of Sunday school classes for all ages and life styles. I'll go back.
