4	Churros were the bad boys I came here for and from which Che Churro gets their name. These fried choux based pastries can be considered latin version of a doughnut; a fritter that's rolled in sugar and cinnamon then traditionally filled with dulce de leche and eaten hot.The warm gooey filling is a great contrast to the crispy crunch of the churro, whose ridges act as built in sugar and cinnamon holders. At a buck a piece - plain - I don't know how anyone would be able to stop at one... or two, for 15 churros in one sitting.
