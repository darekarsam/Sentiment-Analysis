5	Thanks!!! I smashed my phone last night and got there 1st thing this morning and they repaired the glass, speaker, and camera in about 20 min great place.  I will be going back there from now on
5	I took my iPhone 4S to iPhone doctor but they said that they could not fix it. We found wireless toyz by accident and Luis opened up my phone and fixed it in less than 2 hours. Great service :)
1	They had my phone for over a month......couldn't do anything with it.   Did it really take a MONTH to figure that out?!  Never once had a phone call from them with any updates on status.  Every time that I called, they said that they would call me back in the same day or the next.......NOPE!    Nothing!     Find another place!  I would never go back here.
1	I really don't like to leave bad reviews. I purchased an iPhone 5 charger I thought was new on November 29th. I haven't had a problem with it until early this morning. I woke up and the charger was plugged into my phone and about to catch on fire!! I called this morning and talked to someone who didn't seem to want to help. I asked if they sold refurbished iPhone chargers and he said yes, I told him what happened and he said okay?... Okay? My house could have caught on FIRE!! I asked if I could bring it back and get my money back. And he said they will do an exchange. After I told him I didn't want an exchange he told me to just bring it in. His answers were short and his tone was rude. He almost seemed bothered by my call. It was only $16 but I don't think I care enough to take it back by the way I was treated on the phone. He didn't say his name on the phone. BUYER BEWARE! They didn't mention it was refurbished at the time of sale or I wouldn't have wasted my money...
1	Very slow service!  No sign in sheet  (meaning nobody knows who's next) long wait times! Will not recommended or shop here anymore!
