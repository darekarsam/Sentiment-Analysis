3	For a store that's right in the center of Oakland, it's not very student friendly. They treated me like a criminal when I first walked in. They will strip you of your properties...like bookbags and purses. I guess I understand the paranoia since they are located in the middle of a college area where alcohol is like gold...but at least place my belongings in safe place, instead of just throwing it on the counter where some sketchy character could just swing by and then straight for the exit. They have a good selection of wine and spirits with all the sections nicely marked, which makes looking for stuff so much quicker. Well, I kind of have to be quick to make sure nobody steals my stuff. The prices are decent and occasionally they'll have sales so you'll be able to save a few bucks. Due to the rude service and tense atmosphere, it was such an uncomfortable experience. Overall, I'm glad there's a Wine and Spirits in Oakland...it fulfills it's true purpose I guess. Stay classy Pitt!
3	This is a very convenient location to Carlow  University.  I have never had a problem finding what I need and the cashiers are nice.  Nothing here really blows me away it's a little run down but servers its purpose well.
1	Stopped here on Halloween and was allowed to bring my large tote bag in with me (I'm almost 30) while the student coming in at the same time as me was screamed at to leave his backpack at the door.Saw the line LITERALLY WRAPPED AROUND TWO AISLES and turned around and walked out.  No thanks!
2	Oh my gosh, these people couldn't be slower when all you want is to get in and get out. I predicted that it would be crazy a day before Thanksgiving, but it was my birthday and I needed some damn champagne! Fast forward 20 minutes later when I was just standing in line while one of the women behind the counter wasn't even checking anyone out. And the one woman who was actually working answered the phone twice while I was in line. Come on, guys.
