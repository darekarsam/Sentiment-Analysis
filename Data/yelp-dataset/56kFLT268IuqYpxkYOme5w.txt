5	Fast friendly service that is thorough.  Highly recommend for compounding prescription service.
5	I have been doing business with Pet Health Pharmacy for a few years for a dog that requires a compounded medication for the rest of her life. I checked for the best price available, and this pharmacy is much less expensive than anyone else I contacted. Not only do they have very reasonable prices, but they also have excellent customer service. Our dog's prescription had expired, and all I had to do was send a message to the pharmacist. They contacted our veterinarian for the renewal and also informed me of the status of the order. I received an email from the pharmacy before 10:00 AM the following morning that our medication had shipped! This is the way we have always been treated by this pharmacy, and I hope that they stay in business for a very long time.
1	Friendly? Yes. Fast? Never. Billing is always messed up. Drugs are never ready when promised.  So frustrating to deal with. I would much rather deal with the other compounding pharmacy that doesn't make me waste so much of my time.
