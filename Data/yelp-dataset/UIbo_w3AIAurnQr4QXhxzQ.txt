5	I highly recommend Dr. Treon at Treon Dental. My husband and I did not have dental insurance for over 2 years so we went to a dental practice that gave a low price for a cleaning on groupon.com. They told me I had 7 cavities! Six months later I went to Dr. Treon and was told that I only had 3 cavities! Big difference! He has saved my whole family a ton of money by being honest. My youngest son who was 3yrs at the time that we began seeing him loves going to the dentist now and before he had a fear. He is an extremely gentle dentist and will talk you through everything that he is doing while working on your mouth. If\f you are one that is scared of the dentist or scared of pain Dr. Treon is the person to go to! Check him out for a honest dental opinion!
5	a great dentist and a nice nice man. he has a nice little office with a nice and cool waiting room especially when its hot. also i use to go in there and when they were making some things in there lab and it was noisy but now it looks like they have a nice door that keeps the noise way down. but there work is great and he walks you threw everything every time i go in there there is an improvement to help you and they know there stuff. they recommend crest so i use crest so there aint no cavity creepen in my grill
5	Bobby and his staff are by far the best in the area!! We wouldn't go anywhere else!!
5	Really awesome dentist.   Got my root canal done really good.   Was very careful.   I was even able to get my husband to come to him.   Wouldn't go anywhere else.
5	Dr. Treon and his staff make a trip to the dentist very relaxing and comfortable. I have had only pleasant experiences with several different procedures. I am very glad we have such a great Dentist nearby in Central Phoenix.
