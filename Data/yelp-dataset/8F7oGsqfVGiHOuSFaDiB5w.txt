4	It has been awhile since I ate inside Taco Bell. After work, I gave it a try.  The taco and burrito was good on my tastebuds. Ditto with a tropical flavored Mountain Dew, that I have only seen at Taco Bell.  I was happy with the service. The lady who took my order also brought my food to my table. And for waiting a few minutes, she bestowed me with a complimentary caramel apple empanada. I have been to various fast food places, waiting on an order for an indifferent employee to hand me my order without any acknowledgement. So it is friendly customer service that leaves me with a good opinion of this Taco Bell.
1	It's Taco Bell. Nothing great. In fast and poor quality. Nothing else.
5	I went in the drive thru & it was busy. I ordered like 5 things off the menu & they forgot to make my nachos :( But i turned right back around & they were very nice & even gave me an extra burrito! Everything was delicious. I go for their mountain dew blast soda & awesome crunchwraps !
1	Customer service here sucks!  Every time I go to this location I am very disappointed. I go thru the drive thru and order and the person doesn't get my order right the first time or second time. Finally after repeating my order correctly I go to pay and they managed to still leave out one of the items I ordered.
1	This the second time we ate here, place is always dirty, seats and table's not wipe down or clean. This customers tray has been sitting near us, full of trash for about 30 mins while 1 employees are talking at another table for about 30 mins or more.
