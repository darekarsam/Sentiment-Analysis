5	Dr. Gearin is awesome. She's is very courteous,  professional, and knowledgeable. I would recommend her for any domain of dental treatment!
5	I've had dentists in Dallas, Texas and several in Vegas and Dr. Gearin is the best of the best.  Friendliest staff, super clean, great cash pay pricing and best chair side manner ever!   She explains everything thoroughly and so personable.  I have had huge anxiety about going to the dentist after some nightmare situations in the past but after getting treatment by her, anxiety is gone.  She is giving me my smile back and I am so grateful.
5	Let me start this review by saying, I loathe visiting the dentist. LOATHE. To the point where I would make just about any excuse I could not to go. However, I was recently referred to Dr. Gearin by my father who has been a patient with her for the last year. She has totally changed my opinion of dentists! She is wonderful, very kind, professional, and straight forward. I had some cavities filled this morning and it was completely painless. I will definitely refer all of my friends!
