1	I will never go back to this Rite Aid! I had a problem with a very expensive product there and the staff was very rude to me. The assistant manager spoke down to me and treated me like I was stupid. She did nothing to help me or the situation. It was so bad I left in tears and will never go back.
1	If only there was a way to give negative stars...wow this rite aid would be rocking that! How awful can one place be? We already only were using them because of convenience (on way home) but had to go there on 3 occasions back to back (after having a baby) and they simply could not have been less helpful. 1) asking them a question is a non starter. 2) would it bother you to look at me when you are talking to me? 3) sorry I was told this was over the counter, no need to basically scream at me and put me down for not knowing better, it is after all your job, not mine. I could go on and on but long story short, take your business elsewhere, these guys are awful
1	Why I've been coming to this rite aid pharmacy for three plus years now? Masochism I guess. Can't really tell what the issue is here. Understaffed? Could be. But every time I'm here the behavior displayed by the grown people behind the counter is downright astonishing. Always rude, dismissive, burdened by your presence and impatient. Whether it's an issue with morale or lies further up in management, someone PLEASE fix it. Give them their Christmas bonuses so we can retrieve our prescriptions in peace!
