4	I love this place!  It is so much better than the big chain mail places.  The staff is truly friendly and really care about you as a person, rather than just a customer.  It has a small town feel to it, you can sense it from the moment you walk in the door.  It's personal service with a smile and the care of family.  Not the fanciest but great service!  I've gone there several times to send a fax or send a package, and it's wonderful!  Even though I don't live in Gilbert anymore, I would definitely go out of my way to be a patron of theirs.
4	I pay my rent here. They ship stuff, print money orders, sell stamps and greeting cards. A spritely couple runs the shop and they are extremely kind, if a bit brief in their responses. I guess they send faxes too, but who uses those?
5	Great people to do business with. I've been using them for about 20 years and will continue to use them for all my shipping needs.
5	We have been going to Gilbert Mail for over 10 years and really love the small town feeling we get from being greeted by name. They are fast, knowledgeable and helpful. It's so easy to compare shipping methods to find the cheapest way at this one-stop shop!
