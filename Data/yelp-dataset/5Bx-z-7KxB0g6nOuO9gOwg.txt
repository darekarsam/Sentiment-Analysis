5	Took  2 sweaters for cleaning and (my favorite) pair of  jeans that tore in the seat for repair .  Yeah, yeah I know...hit the gym.  Any who...  Prompt service, not pricey and a worderful job patching up my jeans. The entire staff is wonderful.  Got a discount with my second visit....
5	So I'm kinda picky about dry cleaners and wanted a good one when I first moved to Pittsburgh.  Not knowing the areas, I went here.  Yep, it's Homewood, and I'm white.  Anyway, I keep going back and haven't had any problems.  Well done, clean clothes.  Also if you pre-pay you get a discount, which I like.
5	Amazing Work!Sure it's a sketchy neighborhood but the service is quick, reliable and modestly priced. I haven't tried thier tailoring but if it's anything like thier dry cleaning then I'm sure it'll be great. Definite A+
1	I went to their satellite location at 2020 Ardmore Blvd. in Forest Hills.  I took in 4 dress shirts to be pressed only.  I'm not happy.  The shirts barely look pressed.  The collars are absolutely smashed with no noticeable starch which I requested.  Smashed as if they sat a large hot brick on them and not an iron.  NO creases in the arms?  Very disappointed.  It was under $8 for the 4 shirts but what's the difference with doing such a poor job.  Take your dry cleaning elsewhere.
5	Great service and prices.  I took in multiple jackets - including a wool jacket, a vintage silk one and a vintage suede jacket.  I waited a little extra for the suede, but everything came back looking great.  The prices were very fair - as I got a discount for prepaying.  I will be coming back.
