3	Best bar in Lawrenceville. I gotta say Donnie makes you feel welcome. It's a grate bar for us young people.Thursday - Saturday this bar is jumpin with a live DJ'. During Steeler games this place is crazy. So grab your hot friends and come down.
1	Double D's kicked a guy out of the bar for kissing his boyfriend. Avoid this hate ridden establishment. There are plenty of other fine bars in lawrenceville for you to spend your money. Clearly the owners and staff of Double D's doesn't value "ALL" of their customers.
4	DJ on fridays..good drinks nice crowd.
