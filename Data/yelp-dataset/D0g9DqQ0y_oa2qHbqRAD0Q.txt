5	Its very hard not to leave this place without a bag full of stuff. When I needed Drinking glasses for my wedding reception I came here and bought several cases of glasses for a price that was almost cheaper than fancy plastic bar glasses. This place is awesome.
5	Always changing, if you find something you like, buy it that day! Odds are it won't be there when you go back.  There are some great deals to be found here.  Everything for the home, and then some.  Employees are super helpful.  The clearance areas are spread out, and those deals are better.  Most of the time it's small blemishes that are hard to spot.  Great store, check the, out.  Give them 2 tries before you write them off,  because the inventory changes. Like the changing inventory, each store is different. Peoria is more empty (customer wise) than the other locations I have been to. .  :). Happy shopping!
5	They have a great selection of furniture, pillows, seasonal items, kitchen and much more.I like the size of this store and the amount of products they carry.Furniture wise, they have a huge selection of chairs, recliners, sofas, ottomans and much more.They also have lots of room accessories like lamps, stools, side tables, accents, art, mirrors etc.In the kitchen section they have tons of dish sets, pots, pans, bakeware, and gourmet food items like spices, oils, dips, chips, crackers and a decent selection of gourmet gluten free food items.Seasonal item are also always available in an abundance including delicious smelling Yankee candles.The praise can go on but I will stop here for now.
