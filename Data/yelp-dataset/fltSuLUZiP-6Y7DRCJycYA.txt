4	Recommend. Very busy but worth the wait.
4	The people are nice, they work with you for getting things done in the best manner possible and are usually pretty quick about it.  Getting cars fixed, costs money, that's how it is.
5	Gerald and his team are amazing.  I dropped my car off and an hour later they had it ready and waiting for pickup (I've been told they can get pretty busy, so I guess it was good timing on my part).  They came in under quoted price, and were very honest about what did and didn't need done.  Not a lot of places value taking care of the customer over turning a profit.  I'd highly recommend.
