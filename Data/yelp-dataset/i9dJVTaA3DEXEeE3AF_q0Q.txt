4	More yummy street food in the hood. Pork rotating on a spit, friendly service, sauces that you can't get just anywhere=worth a stop. $1.50 tacos, $5.00 Burritos, and tortillas made fresh on the spot! There is a deep red sauce that has a reasonable kick to it, and a guacamole based sauce that is also good, mix the 2 together for a taste sensation. Other topping choices include cilantro, onion, radish, and lime. Karina's 2 is now the 3rd south of the boarder eatery that is worth a stop within 2 blocks of each other...along with I Love Arepas (Venezuelan ) and Amanecer (Salvadorian) All are delish, and welcomed additions to our little neck of the cactus.
5	We decided to try this amazing smelling taco truck AFTER standing in line at luvit custard (yes it smells that good) We ordered one of almost everything on the menu and EVERYTHING was delicious ! We were also offered a shrimp cocktail which was loaded! We drive down here almost every week from north Las Vegas because it's that good. Thank you guys for consistently delicious food!
