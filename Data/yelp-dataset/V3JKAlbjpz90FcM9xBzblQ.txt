1	The drive thru screws up my order EVERY time. When I then have to park and go in, no one even apologizes. I avoid this place.
1	I ordered the southern fried chicken sandwich from drive-thru, it came without ANY condiments on it.  Just a plain piece of chicken on a bun?  Come on guys, get it right
1	Ordered a egg on a muffin. It had cheese. Ordered a coffee. Sticky caramel all over the cup. Not cool for a drive thru. I had to ask for something to clean my hands so I could drive. Employees have serious attitude. I'll avoid this location which is a bummer because it's convenient. It's just not worth the hassle. Every time we've been here, they've messed up the order.
5	Just to be fair. Contrary to othet posts, we take our kids there many times because we live nearby. Both dining in and drive through. Never any problems. The deco is great, upscale looking. Kids love the free archade games.
3	Pretty nice as mcdonalds go. 4 is my standard review on a decent place. This one gets a 3 because of some drive-through mess ups. The biggest one was when I ordered a sausage and egg mcmuffin (and only that!) and instead got a bacon egg and cheese biscuit. Um...not the same thing, folks. Didn't realize until a few miles away when I got the chance to open it. Lame.
1	Went through the drive thru at 5:45 am, ordered a sausage mc muffin and hash brown.Waited 5 mins, got on the road, opened the bag and had some tiny biscut with sausageon it??  Come on guys!  Note to self, check the bag before pulling away from the window.
