5	Someday, when I make my fortune (after I figure out how to do that) I am going to Montreal and I am buying a ton of art here. A gorgeous well let space filled with pieces that range from grotesque, macabre, beautiful, to just plain compelling. In addition to selling extraordinary original art, the gallery also sells books, collectible figurines, prints, posters, pretty much everything you could think of to flesh out your fledgling art collection. Absolutely a must-see when going to Montreal.Aside from the array of things to purchase, the staff is incredibly friendly and doesn't attempt the hard-sell and also doesn't drop the friendliness if it becomes apparent that you are incapable of spending $1k  on artwork.
5	A fantastic selection of contemporary cutting-edge artists with friendly, unpretentious staff in a bright and beautiful space.Great art selection and a diverse price selection makes this one of the best and most accessible galleries I've ever seen. One of the best reasons to venture into the Old City and a must-see for anyone venturing to Montreal!
5	Huge space with well-curated exhibitions of urban/pop-surrealist art. Best yet, the people there are really nice -- even if it's obvious that you can't drop $13K on a Blek Le Rat original stencil on canvas. :) The prices on the rest of the pieces are kinda high (gallery prices, natch), and there's even a room where they keep even more expensive "investment pieces." Despite the obviously major amounts of coin that some people can drop in there, the people that work there are still really down to earth. My partner and I came to check out the art, and the gallery employees gave us great recs on where to find some examples of the street art that Montreal is known for, as well as areas for lunch recs. I'll definitely make this a stop on every trip to Montreal -- and perhaps one day I'll be taking home a piece for myself, too. :)
