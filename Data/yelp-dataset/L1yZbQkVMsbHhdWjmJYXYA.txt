5	My family got right in with no wait. Dr Miller is awesome!
5	I woke up feeling absolutely awful. I was able to get in right away & I was seen by the PA,  Michelle Wine.  She was so sweet, and was able to tell me my diagnosis,  call in my prescription & give me notes for work/school. My insurance referred me & I am very happy that they did. 100 times
5	Excellent service and staff. Very clean facility. I was extremely happy with the care I received and would highly recommend this NextCare.
