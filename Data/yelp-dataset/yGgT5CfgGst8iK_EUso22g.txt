5	The atmosphere was laid back and comfortable, staff was entertaining and attentive, and they did an awesome job on my almond shaped gel nails, and pedi. World Cup on instead of TMZ or the Kardashians, chill music on Pandora (in English), super sweet nail techs who actually understand what I want and also speak perfect English, wine in a real glass not a plastic cup, great polish selection, and super affordable pricing.... I'll be back.
5	Love this place! Nice with customers and i love day pedicure! Strongly recomend it!!! Hpoan is the best!!!!!!
5	I can't say enough nice things about this salon! The staff was super attentive, the music was jammin' (literally- Bob Marley!) and was one of the best pedicures I have had. My friend and I made an appointment for a Saturday afternoon and had such a good time, we ended up staying and chatting with the staff well after our nails had dried. We will 100% be back!!
