4	We stayed at this hotel while we are coming down to look for houses in South Carolina from Connecticut. The room was clean, the beds were comfortable, and what more do you really need from a hotel then that? We were originally going to stay two nights, but we really wanted to go to a new town to look at house before the next day. Thought it was going to be a hassle to check out early, but the people at the front desk were amazingly helpful. We were also going to go to the amusement park across the street, but wow! Those prices were through the roof. $65.00 a person? You have got to be kidding me! Thank you for the great experience here.
5	Clean and quiet, super friendly staff, good breakfast and very convenient location just off I-77. I've noticed that they even reduced the rates lately, which makes it for an even better deal. If you need to be in Charlotte you have to consider how much more convenient and affordable this hotel is compared to anything else in the city!
3	Start with the positives:  room was clean, night check in staff was very nice, good price for nice clean room, good location!  Cracker Barrel right around the corner.Negatives:  lighted light switches(turn off lights and the room glows orange!), stains on ceiling, have had better breakfasts at sleep inns before (add some protein!) We would stay here again however.  The value was worth it!
