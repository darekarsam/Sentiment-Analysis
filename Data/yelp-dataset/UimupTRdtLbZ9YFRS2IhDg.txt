5	Have been here 3 times, the food is great and yes it's a bring your own wine restaurant! What more could you ask for!
5	Best BYOB restaurant in the area. White linen tablecloth, fireplace, cordial service, and excellent food-both the taste and the presentation. The vegetable plate with the main course was outstanding- five different and colourful vegetables cooked perfectly.  Perfect for special evening.
