2	My wife returned a book that she ordered from Wal-Mart online.  She had the receipt and everything she needed for the return.  However when it was scanned in, even though the item was clearly marked on the receipt, the computer did not understand it and kept saying her book wasn't on the receipt.  It took over 15 minutes for a manager to come over and solve the problem.  You'd think a manager would be posted by the returns counter, by alas no, that would be logical.Oh, and I don't know about just Wal-Marts in general, but there never seems to be any hot water in the bathrooms at the front of the store.
4	Over all this has to be one of the better Walmarts I have been in. Store always seems clean, staff seems nice. No complaints!
1	Everything about this company sucks. Walmart treats their customers and employees horribly, I mean HORRIBLY! They destroy the communities in which they sit. I'm done, never shopping here again, I don't care how cheap something might be, there is a high cost to low prices afterall...
3	Pretty clean overall. Good selection, but produce and meats are just barely average. Customer Service is just OK. Nothing special here.
1	It's walmart, I only go here when I have to. otherwise, I shop at target.
1	Skip this location.. They are always out of everything!!! You never realize that's not the norm until you go to the better Walmarts... Yes we r missing out by going to this one.
