1	I went here for a mothers day pamper and the experience was not favorable. I was not spoken to by the tech/ owner during the process. She was ruff and hurt my legs during the massage she rushed through the pedicure and it was not at all enjoyable! I will not be back again!! This was the second time and the last. The time before this there were screaming children in there and it was not relaxing at all!! These places are a dime a dozen around town, however when I go for a pedicure I expect to be treated kindly and not rushed out!!
2	I got my gel nails takin off here yesterday and the lady was in such a big rush she was pushing my hands around and she caught my cuticals many times with the sander and my fingers were sore by the time I left. Not only that she kept catching the sides of my fingers and the front of my fingers with the sander cuz she was in such a rush and charged me 10 bucks for that! They need to slow down and stop rushing
5	I personally love this place. I always get my pedicure here I prefer the man to do it. He takes his time with you gives you a long 15 min massage. I recommend coming before 3  when no one is here if you like me I like my pedicure in silence it's more relaxing that way. Hands down the best pedicure in vegas. 35$ for a deluxe pedicure which includes scrub, cucumber mint therapy, callus removal, hot rock stone and paraffin wax deep with a great massage. I promise you, you will be satisfied.
