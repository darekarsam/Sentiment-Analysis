5	This Place is truly an experience for us!  It really is the best salon and spa in town especially for their prices too.  I loved everything about Pure Salon and Spa at the Suncoast Hotel.....
5	All I gotta say is STACY ( the massuse) deserves 10 STARS!! She was ammmmazing! As a therapeutic massuse she was able to tell me what I am doing to get these freking knots etc. ( aside from never having a real massage) she was able to help me with advise on why I get shin spints when I jog and how to stop them, It was a relaxing, experience, and even if you are staying on the strip, I recommend going here for a massage , gotta make your appt. with Stacey though!!
1	the worst salon and stylists i have ever encountered in my life long time in vegas. they were the most belittling, combative and unprofessional experience i ever had. i had 3 girls getting work done and we all walked out. they wouldn't honor the groupon after they made a huge mistake on my friend. now i know why the salon was empty. they didn't listen to what the customer wanted and did it their own way and when we went back in to get it fixed they tried to up-sell us and then the belittling started. we were i disbelief. i do not recommend anyone if they have any right mind to use their service. they were rude, obnoxious. a terribly horrific experience. galena was the worst of them all.she fought and actually yelled and then blamed it on being russian and talking loud
