1	Duke Energy ( AKA Duke Power) is where if you live I guess in a several hundred mile region you get your electricity from  so basically unless you have your own generator  use Solar Power, or Wind Power you have NO OTHER CHOICE where to get your electricity so in a nut shell its a monopoly the only game in town .          In saying that I would like to share my experiences and observations about this company;          1) I see now that you can ( contribute?) is that the same thing as DONATE? money to their " Carbon Offset Program" that supports programs and technologies to in effect ( they say) make your Carbon foot print Less  sounds great right? Ok tell me the company's and or foundations that have these programs and I will send the money to them   WAIT ... is this Duke energy? So they want me to donate money to THEM for their programs and technologies. WHAT? Hey Duke I am asking for Donations for sustainable living MINE make my electric bill lower!  Seems like they are tugging at the heart string of people that REALLY want to help the environment!          2) Equal Payment Plan.... for your electric bill where each month you pay its  the same because, its averaged out so in times when you use more electricity your bill will be the same sounds GREAT RIGHT? So when I bought and moved into this house I did that and it worked well UNTIL the last payment I get a bill for about  $2000.00 Dollars           I quickly called and said this cannot be right " I am on the equal payment plan" and they proceeded to tell me that it was a average for the last year plus I think they said plus a %10 increase.   I said but , its around 2000 dollars ! They said that's the difference ! WHAT? So I got off the phone and called the people that I bought the house from that lived here the year before. And they said " We where not there most of the time they where building the house they live in now "       Basically they said no one lived there but, we kept the power on.So I called Duke back and told them that and you know what they said? " How do we know if anyone is living there? " I simply said why would anyone want a $2000 dollar electric bill?But, I got no where!  Update to follow...
1	Just a update of my observations and experiences with Duke Energy .When we moved into our house because, of the beautiful trees it was very dark in the evening even after I installed solar lights along the driveway and front porch they just did not put out enough light. So I called Duke Energy and spoke with them about outdoor lighting .            They said the install was free and it would be x number of dollars a month I thought that was a fair amount so 2 lights where installed . All went well until about 4 weeks later both lights went out? I called and requested a service  call thinking it was the bulbs it did seem strange that both went out at the same time.            Around a week later I called Duke and asked when where they coming out to repair these lights? After going threw 3 people or more I was told that the lights where turned off? I asked why? I was told that my power was scheduled for disconnect the next day? I asked why they said that someone? had called and said they where moving ? I said Oh really? i just moved here less than 6 month ago!            To make a long story short it seemed that there was a road by the same name close by and the addresses where confused? I said you have 3 email addresses for me 3 phone numbers I was not called to insure this order was CORRECT  before disconnect AND who verified my information on the disconnect order? No one!            SO...lets just say they cut my power off no one was home except one of my elderly parents that may have to have some sort of machine the runs on electricity ? That could have killed them! Not to mention if I had left for vacation everything in the freezer would have been ruined and those beautiful expensive fish in the tank more than likely would be DEAD!!!!             So when I told Duke that I was never called nor was the disconnect order verified they told me" They cannot contact everyone its would take to much time!!!" Then I asked "is this ever done?" And was told well... no. UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!! And the monthly price on the outdoor lights has increased 3 times so I had them turned off !!!             I guess this is what happens when you have a MONOPOLY !!!
5	Great building, has a Bank of America branch in the lobby and a Truliant credit union to the right and down the hall. After you see the credit union continue to your left and there is a convenience store, Sam's shop I believe.  Before entering the  store there are UPS, FedEx, and USPS boxes behind and to the left.  If you turn right at the store there are bathrooms to your right. Down a few steps are two dentist offices, PDQ pizza, and then the Rainbow cafe is accessible--it also has a street entrance. Quite a lot of convenience right there in the base of the building. Duke Energy leases a lot of space here for office employees.
1	The absolute worst power company in the US. They are constantly spilling coal ash or some other toxic chemicals in our waterways and then refusing to take responsibility for it and raising rates so the consumer pays for it. They have a monopoly on power in Charlotte and they are horrible!
1	They run a monopoly and they know it! If I had a choice- I would dump this company so fast! 1. no customer service (rude) 2. billing issues from their side 3. their issues- but they disconnect service very fast, even in freezing temperatures
