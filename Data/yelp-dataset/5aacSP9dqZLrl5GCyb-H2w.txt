5	I love Costco - you can't beat it.
5	Oh my god, OH, MY, GOD I LOVE COSTCO.Being a student, bulk shopping is almost a must and Costco has nearly EVERYTHING you can ask for from 1kg family sized chip bags to clothes, new books, electronics and fruits and veggies. This place is amazing! I've already decided that if a zombie apocalypse were to erupt, I'm taking refuge inside of a Costco and kicking everyone out. I'd surely live comfortably for months.Heck, they even sell beds, have their own bakery and kitchen as well as an incredibly cheap and tasty fast food shop in the front. The 65$/year (it was 65$ last I heard for Gold membership) is WELL worth the price. You'll save so much money!Yes, the inside looks ugly, yes there aren't that many staff members and that's why Costco is so cheap (apart from selling their merchandise in bulk). Costco realized that a smart customer will not actually care if the floor is of its store is made out of neatly packed tiles or concrete. Costco is there to sell merchandise, not look pretty and it does it VERY VERY well.CEO also pays his employees handsomely on top of it and treats them well.My favorite shop and by far. Surprisingly good quality food and best chicken ever.
4	I came to this Costco as I was helping out a family member with a few personal items for their place and it is still the place to come for food and for some house ware items.  They ended up buying some bed sheets (420 thread count).  For the price I really don't know where you can find a better quality set for the price!  This is what Costco excels in.  You have very high quality items for very inexpensive prices!  Also, all the food products they sell are of higher quality and excellent value!  Sure a membership is a bit of a pain $110 for the black card annually and $55 for the regular but I'm sure for a family of 4 you can save this in 3 months of shopping here!
