5	amazing general tao chicken!!! the best in town!!! noodles too!!! great deals for lunch specials but the best for evening to go in groups cuz of the big round tables!!! perfect for families :D definitely recommend it!!!
3	I don't understand the hoopla. It's average. The food was fine, although some of the plates looked like replicas of others with mild differences. Parking is terrible. And you might stand in line for 45 minutes. but the place was packed... So maybe all those people know more than I do. Try it!
4	I'm a big fan of chinese/schezuan. THis place was good. THe general Tao and the beef broccoli were AMAZING. EVerything else, though, tasted exactly like the previous dish. The peking duck tasted like the sweet & sour chicken which tasted like the stir fried vegetables. I wasn't a big fan of the "special rice" which is pretty much a mix of previous dishes that weren't eaten (or so i was told). Parking was a disaster. A tiny little parking lot in a strip mall. It was horrendous. I would go back just for the general tao & beef broccoli! This place deserves the 4 * just for those 2 dishes!  Anything else though, I wasn't really impressed
3	Didn't sit in but simply dropped in and took some take-out after reading some reviews. Got the General Tao and the Broccoli Beef. The General Tao is good, nothing great however. Hot & Spicy which is nearby is much better. The Broccoli Beef was good.. once again slighted less palatable compared to the Hot & Spicy location.Nothing terrible though the service was very uninspired and indifferent.I'll visit again since this place is mere blocks from where I live and provide a more thorough review then.
