4	Saw that this place had been recently renovated, so I decided to catch up with a mate there for a beer. I must admit, I was dubious about how it was going to be (you can see much from outside), but it's really good inside.Even though you can't see much from the outside, it's quite spacious inside, with plenty of tables, a decent sized bar, and a room with a pool table.The walls are covered in hockey memorabilia, and I'm sure it would be a great place to watch a game IF THERE WERE ANY GAMES TO BE WATCH JUST END THE LOCKOUT NOW FFS!!!11!.....I was there on a Tuesday, and it was $4 Molson Ex until 7pm. It looks like they have a bunch of other specials throughout the day, and on different days of the week - I'm definitely going to go back and check them out.
3	Really cheap, with friendly staff. But this place is totally not my vibe, hockey gear everywhere with loud top 40 music and horny overweight girls.I would stop in here to grab a drink any time I'm waiting by St Henri, but no way would this be a destination.Though this could be a popular spot for a lot of people, I'm just more of a sissy no-TV art bar kind of person.
