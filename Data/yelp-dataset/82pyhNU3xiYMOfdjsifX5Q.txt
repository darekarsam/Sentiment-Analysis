4	Peppy little health food store in Jean Talon market, ideal for when nights of deep fried pickles and hot peppers catch up with you. They have the healthy power green juice in the big bottles, the sesame seed rice cakes, a whole section devoted to gluten free pastas - in fact everything in the store that is gluten free is clearly indicated with a blue dot. You can get Santropol coffee here and homemade peanut butter and organic canned vegetables and Indian food and organic granola bars and chocolates and sesame seeds and sulfite-free apricots. The staff here is funny, cool and incredibly helpful - I once had a guy who worked there take a bottle of mineral water out of my hands to show me the through-the-roof fluoride content in it while explaining to me about how this makes holes in my brain. A horrifying fun fact, and pretty much the definition of good-to-know info. If you're a tourist checking out Jean Talon market there is no real reason to shop here, but if you're a local there's lots to love.
4	Merci is one of my optional stops on my visits to the JTM.  It's a great place to stop in to pick up some basic food items to round out my shopping trip, like a bag of unbleached all-purpose flour, some olives, or even spices.  It's pretty tiny though, and I am constantly impressed by how many different items they manage to cram into the space.  Need some tempeh?  They've got choice!  Need some super fancy chocolate chips for your next baking adventure?  They've got you covered.  The staff are always pleasant and helpful and it's just overall a great place to have nearby to all the plentiful produce of the JTM.
