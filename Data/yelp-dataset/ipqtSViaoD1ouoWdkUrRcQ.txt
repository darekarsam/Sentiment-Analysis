4	Given my astonishing level of ignorance and their somewhat cryptic name, I must admit that despite knowing of them for years, and donating all my old toys when I was in my early teens, I only recently found out what cause Barnados champion. Vulnerable children it turns out, so they're well worth your cash, and  while I've yet to actually find anything I want to buy in this store, I do still occasionally pop in for a leaf through the pile.Considering the stock is comprised entirely of stuff others don't want, expect to find autobiographies of former X Factor winners and second-tier footballers, and loads of those tawdry "thrillers" that bored housewives turn to when their husband's impotence and pattern baldness make the alternative option that bit too stomach churning.
