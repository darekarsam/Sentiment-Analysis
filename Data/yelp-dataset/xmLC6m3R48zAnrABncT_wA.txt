4	This is also for the new Nicos at the Chevron. On 10/23/12 @ 12:05 pm I was in there and yet again this rude girl was there, and this guy that always wears a hat with a big ass Marijuana leaf on it. This particular girl is like talking to a brick wall. As usual I  say "Hi , how are you " .No response ,and no smile ..nothing! Every single time she is there its the same o`l blank look on her face. There are two other girls that are very pretty that work there too, and they are very polite, smile, and are friendly.The kid with the marijuana hat needs to leave that hat at home, as it is unprofessional, and sends the wrong impression of Nico`s, and Chevron.Food is great though, thats why I return....
3	Breakfast burrito is good but it only comes with two teeny weeny stingy little cups of salsa.  Raise the price a little and give me more salsa and I'll give you five stars.  I like salsa.  3 1/2 rounded down to 3.
4	Great authentic Mexican food for a great price. Niccos was awesome. I had the carne as ads burrito and a carnitas taco. Good eats I will be back !!!
