2	This is a very small lebanese restaurant for cheap pick-up or delivery. I had a shishtaouk sandwich there. Very small sandwich, but tasted correct. Not a good choice in this area which is full of other better options, whether lebanese or not. Also, the place does not look very good. I will not recommend this place.
5	Big plates with lots of salad options and pretty tasty. The price is very good for the value. There is a lot of meat on the meat plates, and they do allow some customisation.If you are gluten intolerant, be aware that they cook the rice with some noodles. They will let you swap it out for another salad, though.I like that their take out containers are recyclable. I always feel guilty throwing away styrofoam. And when I ask for no utensils or menu, they listen, too. That's nice. I try to put as little as possible into the garbage, and I like it when restaurants care about that, too.They are under new management and just hired some drivers, I hear. Tonight my dinner got here in maybe half an hour. That was great. They've been slow in the past, but it seems better, now.So yea, I am giving 5 stars. For cheap and fast lebanese, it's a pretty nutritious and non-greasy option. Their shawarma seems to have something a bit extra. I think they add a bit of fennel, and I like it. Their prices are great, and they don't tack on extra $$ if you need to change your plate because you can't eat wheat. Decent, tasty, relatively nutritious and cheap. Yup, no complaints, here.
