1	This is, without a doubt, the worst McDonald's I have ever been to. You have never met a lazier, meaner, less considerate staff. If you feel the need to indulge and have McDonald's, I suggest you drive to any other one than this. We have had them short us change and refuse to fix it, throw food at us, ignore us, and walk away while talking. They are bad even in comparison to other fast food places.
1	I wish there was another mcdonalds closer to satisy my craving for an unsweet tea, alas there is not and i have to SUFFER and end up here. There is only 1 person that i have dealt with that is always kind and she usually works in the morning. The rest of them... seriously... i have sent in numerous complaints to mcdonalds in hopes that maybe something will be done, the last time i was there someone was working in a white tank top and shorts...
1	This McDonald's is the worst I have ever, EVER been too. I've never experienced anything like it in my life. The service is crazy awful. I mean, I have never seen a more miserable group of people in my life! Going through the drive thru at 3 am? Forget it! You'll be there an hour, not even exaggerating. Then you'll get to order and the person you're talking to is the rudest jerk on the planet, then you'll get your food and you'll get someone else's order or just wrong entirely. Seriously, if you have to have Mcdonalds, go to the one on McKnight, or 65 pr even go to Wendys. Don't waste a second of your life! It is so bad it is unreal.
1	If zero stars was an option this would be the place! Dirty floors, dirty counters, rude employees, broken equipment, slow service.  This McDonald's really sets the brand standard.  Just stay away unless you have a lot of time to wait and don't mind your food being touched without gloves right after they handle the money.
