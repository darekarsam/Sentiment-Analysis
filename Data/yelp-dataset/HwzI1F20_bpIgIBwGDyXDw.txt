4	After a disastrous visit to a nearby T-Mobile location, I stopped by here because the other one was so bad.  I bought a phone on Craigslist and needed to get a SIM card so I could get it activated.  I walked in and asked the kid working the counter if I could get a SIM card....he said yes and offered to activate the phone for me so I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of doing it on the phone.  Total time in the store was 10 minutes....awesome.If you're looking for a T-Mobile phone and you're in the area, I recommend this location and NOT the one on Raintree & the 101.Return Factor - 88%
5	This location has the best customer service out of all of their area stores.  I normally wouldn't write a review update for a store this soon after my last review, but I wanted to recognize an employee, Briahna, who recently helped me purchase a phone for my Son's birthday.  She did a wonderful job explaining the benefits of each phone and spent a considerable amount of time answering all of my questions.  She was very knowledgeable of each of the phones and wasn't just trying to sell me the newest or most expensive phone...I bought a great phone that has features that my Son wanted.  She did it with a smile and looked like she enjoyed her job, that is what I call great customer service.  This store is 2 for 2 with me.  I highly recommend it.Return Factor - 95%
5	Nice, clean and peacefully quiet. The two technicians were polite, friendly and efficient. I plan on coming back to this location should I ever need further assistance with my I-Phone accessories.
5	My preferred store to go to for anything related to trouble-shooting and phone cover accessories.
