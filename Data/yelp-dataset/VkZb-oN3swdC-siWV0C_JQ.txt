3	Been to this place twice in the last 2 weeks with the girlfriend's grandpa and brother and I like it well enough. The course is well-maintained and varied and the putting green is, well, there. I only have 2 real problems with this place. The first one is that I keep losing balls in the f******* water and the second is the price....Granted I haven't played really anywhere in AZ but it seems a little pricey for a muni course. It was like $15 for the green fee, $7.50 for rental clubs (which were meh), and $5 per person for the cart. I may be completely out of line, or crazy, but that seems a tad on the high side for an hour or so of golf.That being said, I will probably come back here every once in a while as it doesn't seem to be too busy around 11 on Sundays. Snowbirds must be in church or something but that works out pretty well for me
3	9 holes ,I have been going to this place last year & this year once a week. It's always great, well maintained, nice putting green. Yes I seem to loose balls in the water also. MMMMmmm? The price seems very reasonable to me.
