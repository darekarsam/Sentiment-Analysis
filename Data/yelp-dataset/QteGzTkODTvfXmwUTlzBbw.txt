4	Tammy fixed my favorite sunglasses (not purchased at eyemart) at no charge!  What great, friendly service.I stopped in to Eyemart Express to see if my favorite sunglasses could be fixed.  I will definitely go back for my next pair of sunglasses.
5	Went in and worked with this funny and wonderful man. The whole time my step daughter and I never knew he was the store manager but we can see why after we found out. He was very professional and helpful to all. His staff loved him and they all was laughing with all their customers and just seemed they loved working there.What a Great leader. We will be back because Allen showed and gave us the best service ever.
1	I would give a zero but I can't I bought alot of glasses from this location and not one pair is correct just took my glasses in for repair and still broke now with a huge scratch on the lens all the have been doing is changing management and screwing there faithful customers I am really angry and upset like I said if it was possible I would have given you a zero for workmanship and how you treat your customers
