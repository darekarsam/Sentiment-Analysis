4	For the longest time, I couldn't tell if this gas station was coming or going. As it turns out, it was just under construction for a long time!This gas station is quite nice. There are eight pumps from which to choose. They have an air pump in case your tires are low. If memory serves me correctly, it's $1.00 to use. They refill propane tanks. Seriously...this place does a lot!Now, the actual convenience store part is very nice. Being newly constructed, that's exactly what you would expect. They have all of the staples...beer, cigarettes, candy, sodas, antifreeze, etc. The only thing they didn't have that caught me off guard was 12-packs of soda. Meh...not a huge deal.There is only one other gas station located on 90th, and that's the one attached to Fry's. Looks like there could be a little competition brewing.As gas stations go, there's no telling how long it will remain in this condition. Word to the wise...get while the getting is good!
