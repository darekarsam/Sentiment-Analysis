5	One Life Tattoo is by far the best shop in the Phoenix area. They make things very comfortable, provide a lot of explanation and do really great work.  I was fortunate to have the owner of the shop (Brendan) sketch and ink my tattoo. He took several of my ideas and created a great custom tribal Rising Phoenix design that looks superb. I received several compliments the first week. I was also blown away by how clean, professional and artistic my experience was overall. Great shop and I now have an amazing tattoo.
5	Brent was my tattoo artist and he did an amazing job on my flower mandala. He had good ideas and knew what he was doing.
5	I had two tattoos done by Bren, this weekend. Not only is he the owner, he is an amazing artist. I've had tattoos done in Berkeley and Oakland CA. Bren is by far the best artist to work on me so far. Moving forward, he will be the only one to decorate my skin with art. If you are in Phoenix, go to One Life Ink and see Bren!
