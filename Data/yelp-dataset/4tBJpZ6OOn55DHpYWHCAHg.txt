1	Terrible. delivery guy left flowers on ground and walked away. The flowers were destroyed. 50 to 60 percent of flowers were broken at the bud.
1	They missed mothers day and I called and they missed again. Now I call tog et my money back and they are acting like they are doing me a favor. Sorry, can't trust a florist who doesn't deliver. My mother gets flowers for mothers day, plain and simple. Somewhere there's a florist who wants my business, after years of better service, it seems 1800 is too big for me. They no longer want my feeble birthday and holiday business. So they won't get it. Oh well, that's a grand a year some other company will get.
1	Worse service ever! Charged my card no flowers !   Do not use them they will rip you off!
1	I bought balloons from 1-800-balloons, same company. The 6 latex balloons went flat in less than 12 hrs. I call costumer service and had to leave a message and they never called back. I would use another company to deliver balloons. I was very excited to have the balloons to be delivered to my love one and the product didn't hold up or their customer service.
1	Ordered online at 1-800 Flowers at 2:15 pm.  Paid extra for same day delivery.  Delivery was never made.  1/2 hour hold time next morning at 1 800 Flowers so I called the local store directly  **there are 2 in town, this was the one at 3385 S. Durango**.  She said didn't receive order until 3:30.  Drivers were gone.  Said she "messaged" 1 800 Flowers and they directed her to deliver as planned following day.  No call to me.  Nothing.  All she did was argue with me about how it wasn't her fault.  Piss poor customer service.  To top it off, when I spoke with  1 800 Flowers, they said the florist told her they attempted delivery, but that it was refused!!  LIARS!!!!!  BEWARE!!!
