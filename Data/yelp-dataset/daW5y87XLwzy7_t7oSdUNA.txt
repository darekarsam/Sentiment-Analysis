4	I would give the Black Bear about 3.5 stars.  I guess I would consider the Black Bear Saloon to be the 'sports bar' of the NC Music Factory.  They serve a full menu, have a full bar, and have a huge amount of TV's.  The inside is really nice with a lot of woodwork and brick and you can tell they put a good deal of money into refurbishing the place.  I've been here a few times and have always liked it overall.  I haven't tried the food, but I have friends who have and they say it is pretty good overall.  On Friday night I think the beer special was 12 dollar buckets of bud light which is pretty competitive.  They don't have a huge amount of out of the norm for beer choices; I went with a Oskar Blues pilsner for 4.50 which is about the normal price around town.  There is a really large outdoor area with plenty of large umbrellas to keep the sun away which is nice and in temperate weather it is a nice place to hang out.  There are plenty of bartenders and servers and they all seem fairly on the ball from what I can tell.  I mainly picture this as a place that people will go to before concerts at the Road Runner or the Fillmore or hang out afterwards.  It is right across from Wet Willies and across from Butter so I am sure they will have spill over crowds from those locations also.  I have never been there past about 11 o'clock so I am not sure what it is like late night, but as a happy hour location or a place to go before a concert it seems pretty good.
3	Been to Black Bear twice now. Once for drinks and the other, most recently, for apps and drinks. Great happy hour specials of half off beer and 2-1 apps. Order the fried mac & cheese and the chicken tenders. Fried mac & cheese is what you'd expect...heaven...ha! The chicken tenders were good, but a little bland. Bartender was very helpful and prompt. TV's everywhere including the booths. I'm not over in this neck of the woods often, when I am, stopping in for a beer at Black Bear is a common occurrence!
