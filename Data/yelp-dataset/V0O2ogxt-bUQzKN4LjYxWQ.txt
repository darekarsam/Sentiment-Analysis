1	I had an appointment with Dr. McLeish today & arrived 10 minutes late due to construction on Scottsdale Rd.  It was my 1st visit & was told he would not see me.  They had collected my insurance information (Medicare + a supplement) prior so I suspect he chose not to see me partly because he didn't want to accept Medicare.  He also has a HUGE sign up announcing that he is an alumni of Mayo Clinic so why did he leave the clinic (also in Scottsdale)?  I suspect he wanted to charge more money.  I will NOT reschedule as this gave me a view into how poorly he probably treats his patients.  While I was in the office I overheard the front office lady tell a patient who had just come out of the exam room that she did not have time to schedule his next visit.  She said she would call him later....  Who needs this kind of treatment?
5	I saw Dr McLeish twice and found him compassionate and an attentive listener.  He was skilled in the treatment he gave me.  His office staff was friendly and efficient.  I believe one has to actually see a doctor in order to give an accurate review.
5	Dr. McLeish performed eyelid surgery on me 2 years ago. He did a fantastic job! I would highly recommend him.
