4	Best selection of beer downtown. 150+ types of beer and usually has the number 1,2,5,6,8,9,10,11 and 12 highest rated beers in Canada (Beer Advocate).
3	Good beer selection for such a little market, but other than that it has a lot of negatives.  The owner and help were kinda of rude, but hey what do you expect from a hole in the wall market.The beer prices are VERY steep compared to the super market.I did notice when I got home that 2 out of the 4 beers I got were pretty old based on the brew date.  One of those two beers was skunked (a belgian style blonde).If this is your only option, its not a horrible choice, but if one of the near by SAQs are open, I would go there instead.
4	If you live around the downtown core, you know how hard it is to find a depanneur with a descent beer selection. Look no further, because Marche Cosmopolitain has exactly what you're looking for! With one of the best selections of Quebecois microbrews in the city, as well as a slew of other imported stock, you are sure to find something to your liking. Just be warned - prices are not on the cheap side and they lack in cidre selection (I learned that the hard way). Aside from that, it's pretty darn good!
