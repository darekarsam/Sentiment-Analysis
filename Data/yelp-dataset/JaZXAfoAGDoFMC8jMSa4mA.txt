4	I finally got to try Artizan at their new location. I was perplexed as to why they shut down their Bernard location.But this is much better as it's much bigger and brighter in an area of St-Hubert that really needs places like this. They now offer breakfast and much more than just pizza.Their pizzas are top quality (my fave is the El Mariachi), I just tried the penne siciliana with Italian sausage. The fish and chips were good, but the fries were slightly burnt-tasting. They deliver and have some pizza specials, so definitely a yes for me.
4	Delicious and well-portioned tapas, and the pizza here is AMBROSIAL. YEAH.For starters, we had the Grilled Calamari, Grilled Shrimp, Italian Sausage, and Homemade Fries. The French fries were nothing spectacular, it was well seasoned but not really appealing. The other three tapas, on the contrary, was very flavorful and enjoyable. The Fish & Chips were really average, again, the fries weren't as crispy as I usually liked it to be.My girlfriend and I have this unspoken language when it comes to good food, especially pizza. After our first bites of the Casablanca (red onions, coriander, cubed tomatoes and ground lamb) recommended by the waitress, we just looked at each other with awe, eyes wide open, mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....Yup, and the pizzas are on special from Sunday to Tuesday, the second one is half-priced.
5	We have spent 10 nights in Montreal and have eaten at L'Artizan for 4 of those nights!!! The excellent food, service and ambience is what we have returned for.  Our host was gracious, friendly and above all generous.  Please go here!!
