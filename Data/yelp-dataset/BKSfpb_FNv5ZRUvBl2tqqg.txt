3	The service was O.K., but a little bit slow. The lettuce was wilted and soggy on the burger, and they just raised their prices back up again. I guess they think the slump in the economy is over. Glad that somebody is doing better!
1	This weeks award for the least amount of stars goes to this location. 3 whoppers w/cheese ordered - 2 no onions and the other no ketchup. Should be simple...... Pleasant girl at the drive-through window. Pulled out onto the road and when I open the bosses whopper it was all wrong. The boss is me of course. No mayonnaise, it's got ketchup and no cheese. Did a little U-turn and drove back to the location to get this catastrophe fixed. The nice guy that I am, i gave the girl at the counter my receipt and kindly explained to her I had no cheese no mayonnaise the plenty of ketchup that I didn't want. The order was initially taken correctly so cooks mistake here. Girl at the counter had to explain my order twice to the cook so I'm not sure their level of education but they didn't graduate from Burger King university yet I can guarantee that! Jumped in the van and started heading towards my job, grabbed out that fresh, hopefully made to order whopper and found myself sadly disappointed. Still missing the cheese! Grrrrr I wish I had time to go back for a third hello but time is money so I must enjoy my cheeseless whopper. Sad is me
4	Only been here for breakfast, I feel drive thru it's much faster than the mcdonalds across the street.
