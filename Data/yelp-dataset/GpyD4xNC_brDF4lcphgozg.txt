5	Great bunch of people...I've gone there for years.  Just got a call from CVS they are taking over their prescriptions!  What??  What happened to them?  Why did they close?  I'm NOT happy!!
1	I heard CVS bought them out.Being across the street from CVS was maybe to much competition for that store.Also it changed hands a few times prior to the sale.....Again,this is just what I heard at my pharmacy...I went to Tatum drugs twice,both times my prescription was incorrect.Although I have heard CVS has the same problem at their Tatum/Dynamite location.Update 3/8/13: I just went over to the UPS store and walked by the Pharmacy,Its open,under a new name..Infinity I think it was,but it is open.
5	HELLO EVERYONE!  My name is Dr. Guy Baker.  As you may have heard that Tatum Drugs no longer exists. HOWEVER, I have opened a new pharmacy called INFINITE CARE PHARMACY in the same retail space as Tatum Drugs.  We offer all of the same products and serves as Tatum Drugs did. In fact you may recognize a few familiar faces working when you come in.  Please don't be confused we are not associated in any way to CVS or any other pharmacy.  Feel free to call us if you have any questions 480-656-3349.  See you soon.
