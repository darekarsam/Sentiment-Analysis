4	2 Thumbs Up on Customer Service:  I ordered my window coverings with Louis and she was the most pleasant person I have ever encountered in a franchised store.  She was attentive, patient, suggestive, and genuinely happy to help me in the week-long process it took me to pick out the right cover for each window in the house.  I can tell she enjoys her job and what she does.  She followed up and kept me informed throughout the entire process. They always have my business with employees like this.
1	I usually love Lowe's. But I ordered a kitchen cabinet and it came with incorrect doors. I have already been back to the store seven times and it is still not resolved. The store manager twice assured me that the correct doors would be ordered. Excuse after excuse but no doors. This has been going on for two months. The problem was made worse by the incompetent employees in the cabinet department.
5	December 14 2014 busted 10 yo lawnmower. This is the only place in town I could find a good one. For the winter, they had a really good selection. This alone was a five star experience. Then half way home.... Where's my I- pad??? In a cart out front! Eric in the garden dept. hauled ass to get it after I called. Thank you Lowes, and Thank You ERIC!!!
