3	Not the cleanest pizza hut but my food was hot and on time.
1	Picked up our pizzas, sat down to eat dinner to find the crust on our pizzas was almost completely raw. Doesn't make sense since we had to wait several minutes for them to finish after arriving a couple min late. Now we have to wait even longer to eat because we need to bake our pizzas so they are edible. I think I'll drive to to Kings Dr. Location. Went there for years and had great quality every time.
