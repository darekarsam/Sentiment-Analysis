2	Granted, Taco Bell isn't going to be a five-star experience, but this one is average even for Taco Bell.  Every time I've gone through the drive-through, they've forgotten something or put in the wrong item.  I stopped using their drive through.
3	Probably the cleanest TB I've ever visited.  It looked like pretty capable staffing with actual adults running the place.  I was actually a little confused when I didn't have an obvious stoner giving me the lazy stare over the counter.  It's a slightly hard to notice corner location, but still, good location with access from 90.
1	For a taco bell, this one is horrible.  Sounds weird...right?
1	This is the most amazingly slow drive through ever!!! Just 4 cars ahead of me and it took 1/2 hour!!! Never, ever go here. Ever!
2	really disappointed after going here on 9/30. ordered a am crunch wrap meal. half way to Madison, i took a bite of it and it was cold. not that big of a deal but got to the hashbrown was rock hard. like over cooked and then sat out for a couple of hours. then i drove back and went inside and i talked to the manager. pointed out the problem and asked them if they would eat something like that. then she proceeds to tell me that the person preparing it may have not noticed it. doing some food prep for my job, i called bs on her. in the end, would not recommend the taco bell.
