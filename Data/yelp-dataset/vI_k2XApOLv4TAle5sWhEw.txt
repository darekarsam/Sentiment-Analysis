5	Ryan at Waterboy Pool Service is doing an excellent job for us in taking care of our pool maintenance.  He shows up on time every week and we had an unusual issue recently that he was able to troubleshoot quickly and get taken care of.  He responds to text messages if we have questions (being new to pools) and he is always friendly and professional.
