5	Finally.  I had some problems with our roof and had called a lot of places to ask them to come out.  Finally Collum Roofing did come out and they did great work, very professional and quick.  Would highly recommend them.
1	I would like to truly provide a review but I have been trying to get an appointment for a quote for 3 weeks.  Yes, an appointment to get a quote.  Called them several times and they told me they are busy.  But, they said I could call them back to remind them to call me if I would like.  Are you FLIPPING kidding me!?!?!?!  With that kind of customer service they will not be busy for very long.  Not trying to be mean but there are too many options out there to receive this type of response.
1	Collum Roofing installed a roof at a commercial project in Chandler AZ- we have now been trying to schedule a warranty repair for over a month without any response.  The promised return phone calls never come ...don't hold your breathe...go else where!
