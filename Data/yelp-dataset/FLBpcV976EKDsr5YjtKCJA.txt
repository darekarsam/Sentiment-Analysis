5	I've taken my puppy to K9 Day Out for Daycare and for boarding and they've definately taken great care of him!  He's always thrilled to see Danielle when I drop him off and he comes home tuckered and in a great mood.  It's also great to see pictures of him having fun while I'm away.
5	We boarded our dogs here overnight they we treated with love and respect. the owners are very personable and friendly. Our dogs love it here and we will definately be returning! Absolutely recommendable place for your four legged best friend!!thank you
5	LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!  Danielle and her family are very caring and personable.  We know that Bogey is in a safe and loving environment when he visits K9 Day Out.
5	I was referred to K9 Day Out by another referral. It was the first time we've ever left our dog to be boarded. y wife and I were both a little nervous, because we weren't sure how he'd be with other dogs. Our dog is really clingy and used to humans, not other dogs. But Danielle did a great job easing my nerves, answering questions and giving me peace that my dog would be fine. And, he did. He had a great day and played well. K9 felt homey and comfortable and perfect for my dog to visit and stay overnight. I definitely recommend them. They were great and I will be returning.
5	I cannot say enough good things about K9 Day Out!  My dog LOVED it here and was so happy when I picked her up after a weeks stay.  The owners are amazing and very caring and will put your mind at ease.  This was by far the best place I have ever boarded my dog and will definitely use K9 when I go out of town again or for my dog to go for a fun day trip!  If you are hesitant about boarding your dog (like I was) I can promise you that you will be extremely happy with K9 and your dog will be too!  So thankful I found them~
