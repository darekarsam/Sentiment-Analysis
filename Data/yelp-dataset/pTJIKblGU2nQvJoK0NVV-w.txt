1	Crappy decor.  You would think the money they save with generic styrofoam cups and serving trays and the lack of a dress code for employees would be spent on quality of food.  Nope.   Also, they are a bit overpriced.  Not coming back.
4	I hate to say it, but I liked this place better than Ned's crazy sub. I have been going to Ned's since I was a little kid.
1	This place was filthy!  Food prep area, walls, floors, worst off- the ice tea container. GROSS
4	Steves crazy subs is a DIVE but it has amazing subs, the best in az. I suggest take out because this place is filthy.
