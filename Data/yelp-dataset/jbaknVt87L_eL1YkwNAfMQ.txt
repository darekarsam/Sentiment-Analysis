4	If you are looking to stand out from the norm then look no further then Eltons. The cloths here provide that extra pop that will get you noticed. The Robert Grahm shirts here are exciting and a nice change from the norm. The guys working here are very friendly and were very helpful in making my decision on the shirt I liked. I really appreciated the personal attention I got while shopping here. All and all a great place to shop.
1	The manager of this store thinks he's too cool.  It's obvious he hates himself.  Don't go there if you have any respect for yourself.
1	Stay away from this store. Store credit only on returns which shows their fear of what they sell can't stand on its own.
