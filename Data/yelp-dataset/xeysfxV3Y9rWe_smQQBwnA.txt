4	Best dinner at this small nondescript place on the Plateau. I remember olives.I remember grilled squid.I remember delicious fish and perfect steak. I remember lots of wine and loud merry chatters of the patrons. I remember happiness then and the wanting to get back there soon after.
5	Le Roi Du Plateau is more than a restaurant.  It's a living, breathing organism with a soul.  It's only purpose in life is to put a smile on your face.We came here when on holiday for my friend's bachelor party and the owners welcomed us so warmly that it felt like we were dining in their home.  I loved the fact that it's off the beaten path and knowing about this place only adds to your killer foodie creds.The appetizers were great.  The steak was even better.  But, the wine.  The wine is what made the night.Go. Dine. Enjoy.  You will leave the place filled with joy.
5	I am writing this email to invite fellow yelpers to try this place.  This little hole in the wall has been around for so long I almost forgot it was there.  Until I recently saw an article about them being fined and possibly going out of business, because of complaints from new neighbours. http://www.midnightpoutine.ca/food/2012/02/chicken_out_when_you_smell_smoke_fines_poultry_and_the_scent_of_our_city/ The food is always excellent, you can anything from fish, seafood, chicken of course and it's all good authentic and really good value for your buck.  The service is rustic and while they have their regulars they are always happy to welcome new people and make them feel like a new member of the gang.The house wine is always good, you should reserve if you can as this place is always packed.
5	Sadly, this wonderful restaurant is gone. Five Stars In Memoriam.
