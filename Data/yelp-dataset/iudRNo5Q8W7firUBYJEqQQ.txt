4	An impromptu party/picnic in the yard.   Lots of kids and friends stopped by to see an old neighbor that was in town visiting.  All of a sudden, it was time to eat.  Little Nipper's to the rescue.   Ordered a few different style pizza's and some wings.  Nice crust not thin but not to thick, the sauce is tasty, cheese was nice... gummy, stringy, good.  The pizza's disappeared fast.  The wings were good and a little crunchy, just right.

1	Had the gnocchi delivered. Absolutely terrible. Gnocci's had to have been 2 years old. Delivery guy was shady too.
2	Got into Pittsburgh late this evening and this was the only place around that was still open and delivered after 11 pm. I give them a half star for this. They have a few vegetarian choices on the menu. I give them another half star for this. I ordered what I thought would have the most vegetables, the "vegetable calzone." They ended up delivering a "Mediterranean calzone," which was also vegetarian, but it wasn't what I ordered. The small portion of vegetables was tasty and most of them seemed fresh, so I give them another half star for this. I didn't bother to ask if anything was organic.They told me it would be about a 45 minute wait, but it ended up being closer to 30 and the delivery guy was friendly. I give them another half star for under-promising and over-delivering. This place might be great for people who love fresh made bread and lots of cheese, but it's not a vegan delight!
1	I don't like this place at all. The staff here is always rude and has no sense of care at all for their business. A couple years ago I had heard they smoke over making their pizza. All of their employees tend to be shady. I don't recommend at all.
