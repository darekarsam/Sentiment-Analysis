5	Christine did a great job!  I came in for a Brazilian wax and she is quick and very professional and gets every last hair.  Her space is very clean.  I will definitely be back!
5	I went in for a Brazilian wax so I was a little nervous. Immediately, she made me feel comfortable. You can tell she has a lot of experience because she was thorough & quick. I can't wait to schedule a facial & massage with her. Thanks for the awesome experience!
4	Christine was great. I got a Brazilian, plus both full legs done. She made it as tolerable as was possible. She talked to me throughout the entire process which really helps immensely. I really didn't feel self conscious at all, and right now through November 1st, 2014, all waxing services are half off regular price. I highly recommend her!
5	I have gone to Christine for two months now and I adore her. She is professional, funny, and does a great job. I already have my next appt booked!!
5	Everything is perfect!  I love the online appointments, price points, and massage!  Christine makes you feel comfortable and has the perfect space for a cozy feel.  I know she offers waxing and facials, but is not pushy about trying to sell them.  Her services would be a great gift for any occasion!  I hope to get a gift card!
5	Brought my daughter in for her first underarm wax. She was really nervous, but Christine helped her relax & talked her through the entire process. My daughter said "that was fast & didn't hurt like I thought it would". Already scheduled both our next appointments.
5	Christine did an awesome job on my eyebrows. I was shocked how soon the redness went away compared to other places I had went to.  She has definitely earned the business for all my future waxing needs.
