4	The Smart Stork is definitely for the more sophisticated child!I like to think I'm all grown up, but I couldn't resist heading in there as I'm a sucker for any pink and mini sized! This is probably the only toy store in Bruntsfield, and when one walks past the initial room, which is filled to the ceiling with toys and games galore, there's the most adorable children's clothes section in the back.The clothes are exactly what I picture children wearing; pastel colours, cute and innocent looking! I have no children, and had a little too much pride to buy myself any toys, so I have no idea of the price range, but I just have to stress how adorable this shop is.
4	The Smart Stork is yet another cute children's clothing boutique in the Bruntsfield area. If you're looking for gifts for newborns then this is the kind of place you could get gorgeous presents or christening items that they can keep until they're older and think back at their younger years.They stock all manner of toys, pictures, room decorations, teddies, christening mugs. Most of the toys you wouldn't give to a terrible tot to play with but keep them for decoration, perhaps on a shelf in their room. You could spend ages in here "oohing" and "awwing" at all the cuteness on offer and although it's not the cheapest store, the prices reflect the quality and I wouldn't begrudge paying the prices for the beautiful items for sale here.
