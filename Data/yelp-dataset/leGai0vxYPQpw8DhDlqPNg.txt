4	I often find that, when it comes to desserts, the prettier they are the less likely they are to be tasty and delicious. Yuki, however, manages to make beautifully artistic creations that make your mouth water for more! If I could have her cakes and cookies and mousses every day I would be a happy person, but unfortunately I wouldn't fit through my front door. Yuki also has coffee and salads and sandwiches, as well as some sushi. Everything you need to get you through the day!
4	I'm kinda in love with Yuki Bakery! This bakery is located on Sherbrooke, a couple blocks East of Decarie and makes some really fantastic desserts. I'm a huge fan of green tea products so naturally I gravitated towards TONS of items :D I tried the Green Tea Cupcake (it was super delicious) as well as their Green Tea, White Chocolate cookie - so very well done. I also tried the Red Velvet Cupcake, and Salted Caramel Cupcake. The one thing I really enjoyed about these desserts is they aren't sugary sweet. I found that they were the perfect amount of sweetness, moistness, and you can really enjoy the flavours without being masked by sugar. I'm looking forward to going back and trying out the other varieties. I noticed on the sign that they did featured cupcakes such as Apple Pie and Pumpkin Pie which was really neat.
