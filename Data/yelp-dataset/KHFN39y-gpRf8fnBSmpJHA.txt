5	I really needed some new glasses, so I headed over to Eyemasters on a Saturday morning. I was helped right away by Kenny, he was so helpful. I told him what I was looking for, he found a pair that I liked in just one try and he recommended upgrading to a better lens based on my prescription. My glasses were ready the same day and the best part...I can actually see out of them! (Don't worry folks, I only wear my glasses around the house) It was so frustrating not being able to see clearly without tipping my glasses down and looking out the bottom of them. Why had no one ever mentioned that my prescription didn't work well with cheap plastic lenses before?   And the best part...they were having a sale that day where I got both the frames AND the lenses for 50% off!  Thanks to Kenny & Eyemasters I now have glasses that I can actually wear out of the house and not be a danger to society!
1	I have visited twice, but I can guarantee that there won't be a third trip! The staff is rude and condescending, pushes unneeded  and unwanted upgrades on glasses and the prices are ridiculous. Go to Costco and save yourself  both annoyance and money. If you own or manage this location, get yourself a secret shopper and prepare to be shocked at how your staff behaves.
1	Wrong Rx after first visit.  Saw a second optometrist who changed it.  Left store twice after excessively long wait to order and pick up contact lenses.  Won't go back.
1	Awful. Glasses were promised in 2 weeks instead of 1 hour, and they are 5 days late and still don't know where they are. They lie about when they will deliver and then string you along. Avoid them!
