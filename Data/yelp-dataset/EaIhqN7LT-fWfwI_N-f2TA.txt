1	The dentist are super nice! I had a nice experience with them. But when I had my first visit I overheard the receptionist lady arguing with a customer over the phone saying "if you call this place again I will call the cops" I thought "wow what a crazy customer maybe" then I had to reschedule an appt because I had scheduled it too early and had overslept(my 5 month old spiked a fever and I hadn't gotten any sleep) so she tells me to go in at 2 but I called and said I couldn't make it because I was going to take my daughter to the doctor. & she was said "well, if you miss your next appt then find another dental office!!" Rude!!! I decided to switch my dental office because of that. Disappointed because I really likes going there!
5	I've been seeing Dr. Nia as my dentist for over 10 years. His chair side manners are wonderful. He's so kind, gentle and he makes you feel comfortable. I know the dental chair is no ones favorite place to be but Dr. Nia does amazing dental work and I would trust him with not only myself but my family too. I've also seen Dr. Wruble who is equally great. It's nice to have a choice if you'd like a female dentist or a male dentist. Shelly, Karen and Megan are great dental hygienists. Nothing feels better than having freshly cleaned teeth!
5	Dr Nia has been my Dentist for over 20 years. The office staff is fantastic and always calls and reminds me of my appointments the day before.  From having several crowns installed and regular cleanings to getting in to see him quick for an appointment, Dr Nia has always has taken good care of me. Chris Harvey
5	I've been going to Mesa Dental Care for about 5 years.  Dr. Nia was very compassionate when I came in crying for my crown on a front tooth.  It was really traumatic for me to lose that tooth.  They sent me to the crown laboratory to ensure I got just the right shade to match.They don't keep me waiting and use state of the art equipment and make me feel comfortable about my dental care.
