5	I live in the area and always order from this Pizza Hut never once have I had a problem. The food is always fresh and hot upon delivery or pick up.
1	The worst pizza hut I have ever ordered from. For example take tonight, I placed an order at 10:20 and it's 11:48pm. The hour+ wait is fine, since the email confirmation said 11:37, but how much longer do they need to dish out a simple order? Especially on a Wednesday? It doesn't make sense. I have ordered before and the same wait times exist. Additionally, the food usually comes cold--stale bread sticks and stiff pizza. I should have known better than to order from this location again, but pizza hut is one of my most beloved placed to order from. Apparently not snymore.
4	The only reason I am rating this so high is the fact they have such quick delivery service. I am from Chicago so the pizza is just ok. Counter people and delivery drivers are always super pleasant.
1	Well...... This pizza was quite bad. BLEH!!! The toppings weren't bad, however the crust was like cardboard!! REALLY, REALLY TERRIBLE....     Don't waste your time, appetite or money.
2	I grew up on pizza hut. My mom use to take us out every Friday night for pizza. I never had a problem in the 30+ years eating their pizza! Over the past year, I have ordered from the same one for 9 years now, it started showing up later n later. Which is fine, usually when it gets there you are just happy to finally have food. Last time I ordered their pizza I was sick for 3 days. It was late, it was cold it was gross and i paid for it literally!!! Unfortunately I don't think this will any longer be a family favorite, or tradition :( I spent 50 for the meal and several times that in medical after!
