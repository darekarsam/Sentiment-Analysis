4	While on Vacation, i stumbled in this Gem of a lounge. The decor is awesome, brick/rock floor then nice sleek bar with beautiful bartenders and awesome hookah bar or "chichas" as they call them there. Prices are good, drinks are good, two types of hookahs, regular and premium. i guess the premium has more flavor?...they have appetizers that smelled good but i didn't get to try them. lots of beautiful people walk into this place, music is american top 40's. cigar bar and tables especially made to insert the hookah inside a whole. will definitely go back, next time im in Montreal
2	The shisha is really good, but the decor is really bad with no theme.... Everyone has to order a drink in order to smoke. And if you want to drink alcohol you have to order food. Your friend cannot order to eat and you drink the alcohol, if you drink you have to eat. They only accept cash, there is a machine to take out money who doesn't work well and takes time. The service really sucks!!!!
2	12$ for nachos?! Are you kidding me?! Nothing really wow about it
