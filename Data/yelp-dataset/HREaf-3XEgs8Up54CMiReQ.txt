5	Michal is fantastic. Been dealing with her for years, followed her all the way from Chandler Mall. No pressure, best deal the first time, and genuinely cares about her customers. If you come here ask for Michal, you won't be disappointed!
5	Ask for Michal, she was patient & very helpful. We would definitely go back.Gonzalez - Gonzales
1	Let's just keep it short - AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!!!  I could bore you with all the details but just take my word for it, if you have a problem after the purchase don't bother talking to the condescending manager he'll just frustrate you more.  Just go to one of the other 1000's of jewelry stores within 20 miles.
1	Very poor service here. Stay away!! They said they could help us. Kept the jewelry for a month and then never called. We called several times and they kept putting us off. After charging us over $150 they finally told us they could not help!!  SIX WEEKS later!!  How do you run a business like this. Cheryl the manager was rude, condescending and unapologetic even knowing they made errors!!!!!  Never,ever go there.
