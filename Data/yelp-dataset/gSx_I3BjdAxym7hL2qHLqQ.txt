5	Great massage chairs for the pedicures......plush chairs that actually work.   Free wi-fi for customers.  A chilled glass of soda or wine upon arrival.  And some pretty fancy pedis (I can vouch for Sole Solution....holy moly).   I walked in half hour before closing, got right in a chair.  45 mins later, perfect spa French pedicure.  And Julie got BUSY with my tootsies...I don't think I'll see a cuticle for a month.  One of my best pedis ever.   I wish I could take her back to DC with me.   Fresh clean environment with two flatscreens...and everyone, not just Julie, was perky and warm.  $25 for a regular pedi, $35 for super deluxe callous-removing-tootsie-perfecting pedi.   I call that a solid value.
