5	Great selection of shoes and a very large clearance section that even goes out onto the sales floor. Friendly staff weep don't hound you as you're shopping.
5	I went to DSW on Friday just to check out what's new. This was my first time at this location because I have recently moved to the area and I am so happy that this is my new store!The people were so friendly and helpful! Even though I only had a few minutes, I ended up getting 3 pairs because the prices were awesome and they kept on top of what deals I could get for what I was looking for.  The 3 pairs I got cost less than what I would pay for one pair!I was very impressed with the staff. I didn't get anyone's name, but the tall man that was helping me was super friendly and made me feel right at home. The lady that rang me up was really efficient with helping me change my address so that I could make sure to get the coupons. I will definitely be a regular there from now on.
5	The staff is super friend and they have a lot of sales....  SWEET!  Great selection of different type of shoes.
