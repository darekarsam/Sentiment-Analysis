5	I went here for breakfast on a Sunday around 10am. I was happy when we got there and there and there was no line up :)The service was quick and our waitress was friendly. I ordered the notre-dame which is basically bacon, sausage, eggs, potatoes, brown beans, pancakes or French toast, and a bit of fruit on the side. I had no complaints with my food. What really impressed me was my boyfriends meal....a breakfast Poutine. Yum. It had breakfast potatoes, duck, a hollandaise sauce and an egg on top. Most delicious thing ever. It comes with toast or a baguette, and a good size bowl of fruit. They had a good assortment of fruit and it was all fresh and delicious. I will definitely be recommending this cute little cafe to my friends :)
5	This review is hard to write with the river of drool coming out of my mouth as I think again about their duck breakfast poutine.   Really cute little place with a great menu, for breakfast, lunch, or just a coffee, that they sell individually. Reasonable prices, fast service and ....And..... HUGE portions. I did something I almost never do : not finishing my plate. This was kind of a shock, but I just couldn't make it. Shame on me. The fruit cup coming with the poutine was fresh and really good. And yes, the poutine was divine. If you happen to be around, this place is definitely worth a try. Almost forgot about my mocha : yum.
