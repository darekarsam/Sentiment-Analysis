5	I love the empanadas from the Empanadas House! They're authentic Argentine empanadas and they are delicious! If you have a sweet tooth try the Dulce de Leche with Walnuts!
5	These empanadas are excellent- we are Argentinean, so we know good empanadas, and these are the real deal. The price is very reasonable for the large size of empanadas you get and they are delicious and very fresh. There are many varieties available, but the classics like beef and chicken are especially good. The dulce de leche empanadas are to die for!
