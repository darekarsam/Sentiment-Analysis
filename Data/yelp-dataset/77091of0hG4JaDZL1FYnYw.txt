4	My friend suggested this place and although I don't live too far away from it I had never heard of it. I didn't try any food so I can't comment on that, but we did have hot chocolates which were amazing! My friend got the spicey hot chocolate and I had the bueno nutella hot chocolate which looked pretty epic and tasted amazing! I'll have to go back to check out what else they have on offer as the menu looked like it had some interesting things on it.
5	I just realised I never reviewed The Zulu Lounge. I have been getting lunch and amazing coffee here for over 1, 5 years now. They have amazing salads and soup with proper nice bread and the best coffee in morningside, possibly the best in Edinburgh.  The place is tiny but the take away prices are great. Around lunchtime you have to be prepared to wait a few minutes as it is very popular. If you want a nice and healthy lunch (they have unhealthier alternatives as well) this is the place to go! They also have amazing looking cupcakes and other sweet stuff which I have been (just barely) strong enough to resist so far!
