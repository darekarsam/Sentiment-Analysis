5	This UPS store has been great to us the last 5 years. The service has always been great, friendly, quick, and dependable. Whenever we're in, the employees are always greeting people who come in. It is usually busy, but the line is worked down pretty quick each time. If you're looking for a mailbox, they have those. They sell just about everything you could need for shipping something, and other random stuff. I'm glad they're in the area, and it is nice to go to instead of the post office 12 miles down the road.
1	Lack of professionalism.  Employees do not treat customers nicely. Very disappointed.
5	Always friendly and helpful. Have worked with them for years. Love that they always smile when I walk in and are always very helpful with anything I need. Some may complain that postage is a bit higher but I gladly pay the small difference to be able to stay in San tan valley, avoid the post office lines and support a local business.  Teresa and her Staff are awesome!
