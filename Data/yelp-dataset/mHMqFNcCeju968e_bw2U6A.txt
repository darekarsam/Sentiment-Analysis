2	I was in the neighborhood (at the Restore next door) and thought I would pop in for a quick and cheap shop. Well, I was wrong. I didn't feel that the prices here were all that great. They had all the usual name brands and a decent meat department (chicken feet! ick!).I had to return my shopping cart because the first one I grabbed had a flattened wheel.I also tried to sign up for their "MVP" shopper loyalty card, but they were out of applications. There's a huge price difference with the card, so fortunately the cashier was willing to run it on his card.
3	When I'm in a pinch for something quick and low priced, I'll head reluctantly to the Food Lion instead of the Harris Teeter by my house. This review isn't for ALL Food Lions because I've been to some pretty nice ones... it's just this one. First, I don't like going there by myself, because it just doesn't scream "SAFEST PLACE IN THE WORLD" at me as I'm walking in. I mean I know there is typically an officer standing there when you go in or two...But it's not so unsafe feeling that I won't go by myself. I just prefer not to. But for a grocery store, it's decent. The produce section isn't really that amazing, but the bakery section is. I know this store is after my own heart because I'm a junk food junkie...who needs fruits and veggies anyways right??? I signed up for the savings program they have and honestly I do feel I save more here than at many local stores. I'm sure I'll begrudgingly return. Oh and they'll never have a shortage of shopping carts... I guess enough people ticked them off by stealing them that the parking lot now has sensors that will lock up the wheels for any would be thieves. See, that's reassuring right??
