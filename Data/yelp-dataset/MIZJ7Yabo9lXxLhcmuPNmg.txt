5	I discovered this place after they had a Groupon for one month's worth of unlimited classes and 2 private lessons. One of my best purchases ever.For one month, I decided to take as many classes as possible in as many styles as possible. I had done ballroom dance throughout my life but had never formally taken lessons. I was hesitant at first -- Would I get bored because things were too basic? Would I feel overwhelmed because I did not know the names to moves? Luckily, this place was intimate enough to where everyone in group classes received a lot of attention.Some highlights: Jase's classes are particularly fun -- Cha Cha and Hustle. He is really upfront but makes sure that you are having fun. I took my private salsa lessons with Josie -- she owns the studio. There's only one word to describe her: Great! She really makes sure that you are constantly challenged and really cares to make sure that you learn.I highly recommend this place. It has its cast of regulars and is overall really charming.
5	Great Tango lessons.  The instructor (Paul) REALLY knows how to teach tango to us enthusiasts!
5	Really enjoyed my first private lesson with Donna and then hung around for a group lesson And their social dance party on Friday night.  Great deals to be had for beginners.  I benefitted from a Groupon for two privates, a group, and a party for only $29...a real bargain.  Enjoyed meeting the staff, the owner Josie, and some of the regulars.  Drop in group lessons are only $10 if, like me, you can't afford the private lessons right now.
