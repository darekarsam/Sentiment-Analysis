1	Stay away! This place used to be awesome! I probably spent around $500 here since I learned about it, but unfortunately they replaced all of their management with new people.Normally, this wouldn't be an issue. But the new management informed me that they no longer do any of the deals that the old management did. Also, the new management was incredibly rude. Every time I asked them a question, they would stare at me like I was stupid. I really liked chatting with the old employees as they were actually nice to people.Needless to say, I am taking my business elsewhere and will never go back. I put up with the insane prices because I liked the employees, now it is just insane prices and rude employees. Go elsewhere or order online, it will be cheaper for you.
4	They have a superb tasting section. You can sample any flavor you like.  2-4 pm is happy hour.  20% I think. I had great customer service.  I'll go there again.
4	They have a great staff that asked me questions about my setup and what I wanted to achieve. More importantly they listened! They helped me fix a problem with my ProTank 3, no charge.Try their house Summertime Tea.
5	Matt and Amber are awesome! great customer service and awesome sales. they're so well informed and are happy to answer questions. I've had nothing but great experiences here! only suggestion would be a second employee (or ipad checkout kiosk) during busy hours. other than that, I feel like family every time I walk in and excited about vaping when I walk out.
5	Matt is an amazing associate who goes beyond the call of duty and answers every question possible. He is so willing to make your vaping experience impeccable.  There is no other place I will go now just because of the phenomenal customer service. Ask for Matt.
