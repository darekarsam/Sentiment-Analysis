4	This little neighborhood drug store is tucked away in the Cotswald neighborhood just down the street from the Pizza Peel.  I used to shop here and get RXs filled here when I worked in the area.   Employees are very friendly and helpful.  While the store is nothing on the scale of a CVS, Riteaid or Walgreen's, you can find greeting cards, medical supplies, vitamins & supplements and a limited selection of other drug-store items.
5	I had no idea that Walker's Drugstore was right here across from Cotswold Mall! My doctor in this area sent me to Walkers. Walker's filled my two prescriptions faster than any chain store ever has. I sure appreciate independent businesses in my area and I will shop here again! Thank you Walker's-friendly, fast, professional service.
3	They very bad at communicating with each other in the store because I called and had my prescription filled for my dog and the clerk said it would be ready by 12PM but when I came they said they don't fill prescription on the weekend and holiday. So I have to wait for another 30 mins for they to fix his prescription when I live on the other side of town.
