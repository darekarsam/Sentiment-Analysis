3	Nice shoes, helpful staff, but pricey. Didn't find what we were looking for.
4	Very nice store.  A little pricey, but had great selection of quality shoes--many hard to find stuff, too.  Very helpful staff.  I felt bad for them because they are a stand-alone shop, so you have to be committed to going there instead of just browsing at the mall.  Worth the drive if you are looking for something really comfortable that will last a while.  We were just browsing, so we didn't go home with anything special.
1	In late spring I was in champagne and needed sandals. I had left the store once , but returned to buy a $200.00 pair of Fidelio sandals. I had nver in my life spent that much on a pair of shoes, I cant begin to tell you how angered I was when I was in y favorite shoe store in Geneva, Il and the owner told me I had been "ripped" off and that those sandals cost between $150 and $165, but NEVER $200.00!!! He sells the same sandals. Mossers should be ashamed of themselves for deceptive practices!! Buyers beware. Those "pricey"  shoes are that way because the owner is stealing customers money!!!
1	ASSHOLES!!! Went in there to look for a pair of shoes and the woman didn't even offer a different color anything when I asked for a certain size.  She said we don't have that color in your size and started fixing things on the shelf.  Rude rude rude!
5	Have purchased several shoes here.  Prices are comparable to most places.  I'm a savvy shopper and I compare prices online.  They don't sell cheap shoes so don't expect payless prices.  With that said I think I have only paid full price on one pair.  The rest have been on clearance (love that! ). They have a room with a large array of shoes that have been discounted by about 50%. Just bought my mother two pairs for the price of one.  Staff is friendly and knowledgeable.
