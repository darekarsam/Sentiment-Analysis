4	Location! Location! Location!  Our room faced the organic market right across the street.  There is a pretty amazing toy store around the corner towards the northeast.  To the northwest, there is a convenient local train stop (Europa?).  The hotel gave us vouchers for unlimited local train rides for the duration of our stay.  There are also restaurants and bars right in the area.  If you take the train east a bit to the KIT Durlacher stop, there is an awesome restaurant called Der Vogelbrau.  They have amazing food there!My sister and I stayed in Room 402.  It was tastefully decorated.  The restroom had nice tiling and cute pictures on the wall.  The bedroom wall had a giant city print.  You can open the window and stick your head out to look at what's going on outside.The people at this hotel were extremely nice. They offered us glassware and plates for our room, so that we could enjoy the drinks and snacks we picked up from the market.  They spoke English!Breakfast was the same every day that we were there.  Deli meats, breads, and cereal.  They also had some cool cheeses and spreads that I'd never seen before.Service:  5Cleanliness:  4Breakfast:  4Cost:  5
