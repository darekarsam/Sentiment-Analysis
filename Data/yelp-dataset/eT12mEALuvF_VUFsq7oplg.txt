Perhaps, it is a little too close, OK - enough about location. Good to know they bring in fresh baked goods daily because the place is too small to bake their own (the girl behind the counter told me). You still get the look and feel of home baked. The pile of Pain au Chocolat caught my eye specifically. They cost about $2.50 (is that the going rate these days?). Tasted the Mocha Latte, which was flavorful, but not too rich. Speaking of rich, they have a bunch of Marzipan (almond paste) edible figurines under a glass cover at the counter. Threw me right back to my childhood. My Mom would treat us with a nice dose of sugar shock. Sweet - literally.
