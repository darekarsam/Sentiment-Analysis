5	Thank you men in blue for helping us find our car the other night after the YEE in Shadyside! We embarrassingly forgot where we parked. I called 411 to get a police dispatcher (I didn't want to tie up the 911 line), and within minutes TWO cop cars came. An unmarked car took us around until we found my precious Callie (my name for my car)! The cops deserve kudos this time!
1	I am angry with the Pittsburgh Police department. I don't feel protected, and/served.  I have been wanting to write this review for a long time, but I was afraid to start trouble for myself and out of respect for my  boyfriend's mom who has been a police officer for 20 years I usually keep my mouth shut on this subject of the police.But I am sick and tired of people getting brutalized at the hands of the police and nothing being done about it and one of those people was my sister who is 27 years old. My older sister has a open complaint against police officer.  You can read about this gem a of man in article written by the Post-Gazette http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/neighborhoods-city/officer-cleared-in-off-duty-assault-on-south-side-345500/He was put on patrol in my mom's housing complex the East Commons on the Northside. to "keep the peace" and by peace keeping I mean to demean , threaten and brutalize young women coming out of their mother's front door on a holiday. There are two sides to every story...and my sister wasn't fully right in the way she addressed him but to humiliate her call her names and cuff her  put her in the back seat of the squad car to make a show for my mom and grandma was just sickening.He called my older sister retarded, cuffed her put her the  back of a police car all to shock and threaten me my mom and grandma who were standing on watching. This happened on the fourth of July.  What a helleva a way to celebrate Indepence Day by being shown just how free we are not.
