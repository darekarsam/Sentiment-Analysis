5	I just want to take the time to discuss my recent experience at Teapot Studios. Teeya is an amazing artist that is great at what she does! She was on time for my scheduled appointment & went to work right away. I asked several questions while Teeya performed my service (requested an asymmetrical bob), and she answered them all w/ great knowledge and zero hesitation. I have had bad experiences w/ getting a bob done in the past & she assured me that I was in great hands. Teeya was very professional & went out of her way to make sure that I was comfortable and overall satisfied!!! She also gave me a complementary beat down (makeup makeover) I am more than pleased w/ my service and my hair!!! I recommend anyone to go to her for any any all hair needs. Please see attached photos!!!
5	I love coming here! She really caters to your needs, and gives me exactly what I want.  She's friendly, professional, and I love the comfortable environment. Can't beat the service especially for the price. She even helps give me new style ideas when I want to try something new. Finally a stylist in Vegas that I can stick with.
