4	Your basic hometown barber shop.  They seem to remember everyone, including names and stories.  If all you need is a haircut, this place is cheap, fast, and friendly.

4	Favorite Madison barber shop, have paid much more for a much worse looking haircut elsewhere. Parking on game days is a nightmare so keep that in mind. Three barbers work here, have gotten a good cut from all.
4	Solid place to go for a fairly priced and quick haircut. The barbers are great to talk to, especially if you like sports. Don't come here on game day since they'll be closed during.
5	Fuck yeah this place is great. Very old school. Great conversation. I like all the guys but Tim's my favorite. While they don't do shaves, whenever I feel like getting rid of an unruly beard off they'll take clippers to it for no extra charge. They love to talk sports. They are closed on gameday but that is probably just as well since parking would be a nightmare anywaysEvery time I walk out of there I feel manlier than Ronald Reagan whittling on a horse
5	Best barber in Madison. These guys know how to cut hair. Ever since College Barbershop closed I've been searching for a good barber. Stadium Barber is it! The barbers are polite, a great conversation and know how to cut hair. It's definitely worth the walk for students living on the East side of campus.
