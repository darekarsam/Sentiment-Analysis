3	I swear, my last review from Canadia for a while.this is a decent little pub. it manages to have a bit of a touch of a dive bar, a lounge, and a sports bar simultaneously, without feeling like it tries too hard to be one or all of these. I appreciate that, it's just a bar, no pretentiousness.beers are decently priced. there seem to be a lot of locals here. there's a back area with couches. service was decent.damned if I can remember the name of the one beer I had but it's a dark one and really tasty. something De Nuit. anywho, I bought two, one for myself and one for my friend Keith, but he doesn't really like beer to begin with, so I ended up getting 1.5 beers to drink. hurray for me being a trash compactor of booze.sadly, we left this place to go bar-hopping, only to find that bars in Montreal seem to close around midnight on Wednesdays. for a city that has whole blocks reeking of marijuana (seriously), you'd expect more late-night activity. damn, I woulda stayed and drank more beers...
1	Smell like a bathroom. Drinks taste just the same.
3	Someone said this place smelled like a bathroom. I'm pretty sure that was the guy sitting next to me. This place is fine. Nothing special. I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to return, and I live within 200ft. But it's ok.
