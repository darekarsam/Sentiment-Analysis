5	We've used Duke for many different homes. Always prompt, always professional. Very competitive rates. They are our one and only call for all our rentals' carpet cleaning needs.
5	Very easy to work with family company.  Very quick scheduling and low prices.Removed several stains from my rental house bedroom and even helped do a quick patch at no charge.  They even said they wouldn't charge for the room if they couldn't get the stains out.Highly recommend!
5	This company is professional, courteous, prompt, friendly, & flexible.  This is the company I will be using every time going forward.  They have helped me out with tight deadlines for my rental so that I can get the home ready quickly for the next tenant & not have it empty for to many days.  They are very kind people that truly care about the quality of work that they do & it shows.  I thought for sure I was going to have to replace the carpet after I had a tenant that abused the home, but Duke was able to make the carpet look very good again.  I would highly recommend them to everyone!  Thank you for the great job!
