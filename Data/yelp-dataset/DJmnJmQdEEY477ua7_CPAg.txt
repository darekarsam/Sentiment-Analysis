2	The service was friendly enough. Atmosphere is pretty basic with limited seating. Food arrived in about 10 minutes. The issue for me was the food itself. I had General Tso's chicken. The photo pictures it with brocolli. None came wtih mine, just fried chicken and rice. And the sauce was so sweet that it was really hard to enjoy. There was no acid or spice, just super sweet sauce. The rice was really average and the eggroll was right in line with the crappy quality eggrolls you seem to get everywhere these days. What happened to the old eggrolls filled with meat? Now they are all sprouts and no flavour.
4	Typical chinese food. Nothing special. Better service than most.
2	If you want large portions of Chinese food, but not picky on the quality, then you'll like Kitchen Wok. The food lacks flavour. It's all so bland. I got the general Tao chicken and it's a sweet, sticky mess. No veggies to be found. The wonton soup is flavourless. We wanted a substitution on a combo for one meal and they charged an extra dollar for it - in the end, they didn't do the substitution, they gave us the menu combo platter. Found out once we got home.I've gone a few times as a matter of convenience. Moving forward we will go to Kam Yin down the street.
