1	Wow. I'm astonished at the bad level of service. I had a good sized print project to take to the print department but no one was available. There was 3 employees and 1 manager standing at the checkouts LOOKING RIGHT AT me but no one acknowledged. So I crossed my arms and stared at them in a very impatient gesture so they would realize that I was waiting for THEN, but nothing. Are you serious?! U had to send my mom over to ask then to help me. They git in the Michael to call for help only to eventually have the manager, who saw me waiting, come over. OMG. So rude. Would not acknowledge me, say hi, or can I help you, or sorry for the 20 minute wait. Would not even look me in the eye or answer questions.  I took my biz ekswhere. Truly ridiculous way to treat customers. Will never go back
1	I completely agree with Elli with too many employees standing around and top it off the GM is doing the same "looking like an idiot."  I can't believe that's how they get paid, I'm surprised they haven't been fired.  They are surrounded by many small business owners waiting for "a handout?"  Apparently they are not well-mannered and did not get trained.  How are they in still in business or do they think they are not in competition with OfficeMax which is down the street.  Yes, they are rude and they think that by "telling" me instructions on how to operate a fax machine thinking I can hear them.  Hel-l-l-o-o, I'm deaf you moron!  RUDE, RUDE, and RUDE!  I've come once a year for three years hoping they have changed, nope they're still rude and I will see that their business gets closed sooner.
1	Wow people in this store are rude. I was in there exactly 2 minutes and was shocked at how rude the print lady was.  Not gonna go there again.
