3	No CAKE POPS!  No chocolate chai mix!  Won't take my Starbucks card.  But at least it's close to the room elevators...
1	Worst Starbucks staff hands down. Waited 15 minutes for a drip coffee while staff stood around, laughed and chatted. When I asked if the coffee was ready, I was told, "you need to wait". This is uncharacteristic of Starbucks and I'm surprised to have this bad an experience.
