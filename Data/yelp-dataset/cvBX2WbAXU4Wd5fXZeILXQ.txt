5	I adore MAC make-up and their liquid Studio Fix foundation is the best foundation I've ever used with a coverage that last all day! On my last visit to the MAC counter in Harvery Nic's, I was topping up on my Studio Fix as I was running a little low. As always, there girls working looked amazing with the most perfect make-up, it must be so annoying having to put it on to go to work for 9 in the morning, especially if you've been out the night before. I wonder how long it takes them? Anyway, when I requested another bottle of my favourite foundation the girl who served me was really friendly and helpful and even let me try a couple of the new eyeshadow colours and I left with a gold shade that was really pretty and a perfect shade for the summer.If you're looking for make-up that makes a statement then head along to MAC, the staff are always very knowledgeable about all the products and are highly skilled make-up artists so you can try out new looks too. If you're into more subtle make-up then you can still find colours to suit at the MAC counter but it works best if you're looking for bold, bright colours and aren't afraid to try out new looks.
