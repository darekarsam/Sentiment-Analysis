4	Very good BYOW Italian restaurant located on the waterfront.Food : very good. Yeah it's Italian food and we see a lot of similar restaurants in this city, but I have never been disappointed (always pleased actually). They make pretty good lamb, as well as home made pesto.There are several other Italian restaurants on the waterfront in Lachine, this one is one of the best in my opinion.Service : nothing short of excellent. Wait staff always tends to you and makes sure you are satisfied.Decor : very simple, but elegant. Beautiful terrace with stone floor.I would definitely bring friends here.
4	Great little spot near the Lachine canal. It is a BYOB and if I am not mistaken there is a SAQ not that far away. Food is simply amazing. Fresh, simple dishes are very well prepared and served fairly quickly.The wait staff is super friendly and you can feel the vibe that they do enjoy working there and with each other.The place at night is quite packed and can get very loud so am not sure if it is the perfect romantic spot for dinner. I would say it is much better if you are a large group.
