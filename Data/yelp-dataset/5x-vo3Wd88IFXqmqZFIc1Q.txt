3	I'm not the biggest fan of BOFA because of their fees, but I get a discount because of affiliations. I find this branch to be a bit slow at times as far as lines or waiting for someone to help you in their office. Other than that, it's meh... all right.
1	Worst Bank of America branch ever !!! I went in there to get some answers to some questions I had . The supposedly manger made me feel so discriminate . He didn't let me even finish asking him my ? . Just told me to wait , he didn't sign me in or even ask for my name nothing . Waited there like 15 min no one came to help at all . The bank wasn't even full it's was in the morning when it's usually empty . I don't know he just judge me for being a young Latina women . But the point is they made fell bad and I'm never going step a foot in that bank ever!!!!!!!
5	This bank is the friendliest in Vegas!!! Everyone calls me by name when I walk in the door and they always have smiling faces!!! Very clean and professional!! Also with the ability to set an appointment online before I come in, my customer service needs are taken care of quickly and with excellence! In and out!And now that the ATM can do cash and checks I have no need to fill out silly deposit slips or wait in a line if there is one. Quick and friendly this location is top notch!!
2	You will be the 10th person in line and you will wait for only 2 tellers to get to you. And wait you shall...
