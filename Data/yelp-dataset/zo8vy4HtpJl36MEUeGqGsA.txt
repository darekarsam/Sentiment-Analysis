1	Ordered salad , gross. Ordered sub, still gross. Guess they only do fried stuff. Don't go.
4	Great delivery and take out service. No longer an eat-in restaurant, but you can always hang out at the cigar bar across the street, grab a drink, and they'll run the food over to you!Burgers are great, crinkle cut fries. Also got the naked wings-they are BIG and were cooked perfectly. Very friendly but can get busy. Don't give up if you try to call and don't get through!
5	Don't let the fact that it's a dive scare you off. They've got great crinkle cut fries, an awesome fish sandwich (perch or whiting), tartar-y tartar sauce, and flavorful hush puppies (I think they put onion in them). I've eaten here quite a few times and the food is always perfectly cooked and made to order. The prices are very reasonable, too.
