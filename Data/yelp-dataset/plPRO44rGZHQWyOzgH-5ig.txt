1	I had been a customer for over 3 years at this UPS Store Location.  Customer in terms of holding a PMB (post Mail box) and shopping for odds and ends for shipping supplies.  After all my patronage I was late on a payment 1 week (because I was out of town) the owner charged me a late penalty fee.   Kept saying she has lots of customers and that she cant help me.  So I am taking my business elsewhere.  Keep your customers but not this one...
2	They'll pack & ship for you at a price. Everyone believes UPS Stores are the same as UPS, you're all wrong. They're here to make money and operate like drop off station. It's best to just go onto the Internet and print your own label, you'll save some cash and headaches.
3	Yes, they are in business, to generate a profit.Yes, they have to pay rent.Yes, they have to pay utilities.Yes, the have to make payroll.Yes, they pay taxes.You will pay an upcharge, over the shippers' posted rates.Why ???  FOR THE CONVIENCE. Plus to cover the above expenses.If thats a problem, then drive to the UPS Terminal inTempe.Round trip, in gasoline alone, probably $6.If you're returning a package, with the destination paying for shipping, apply their label .... and drop it off .... its FREE.They'll even give you a reciept showing, they accepted your package.Make sure, you ask for that receipt.
2	Unfortunately this UPS location is less than friendly or helpful.  Try the location near Fry's in Fountain Hills.  They are very friendly and helpful!!
4	They operate a "service" business so your experience will depend heavily on who is working.  I walked in the Saturday before Christmas and they had one poor guy working. He was busting his butt and had a great attitude.  Kudos to him.  Shame on management for not giving him help on one of the busiest shipping days of the year.
