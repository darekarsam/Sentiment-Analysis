4	Very patient and nice. Some of their jewelry is affordable for the common person. I bought my girlfriend a necklace, a ring, and earrings there. Each time, I had great customer service.
5	Very welcoming, warm and patient. Always with a smile and helpful. Keeps you informed on the updates and try their best to get what you want. Loved it and would prefer always shopping with them first!
1	This location hates to do returns of their merchandise. Purchased from their online site, had original receipt. Customer service was terrible and they tried to refund less than what I actually paid for the merchandise.  Additionally they made me wait 30 minutes for a manager to try and help me out.
1	Terrible customer service!  I waited for over an hour without so much as a greeting. I would have left sooner, but I was due fir my 6 month check up on my wedding ring. On of the associated attended some else who wasn't waiting as long because they were standing closer. Not that anyone was keeping track of who was there. When I was finally attended the lady checked the ring in front of me, shook it near her ear,  said nothing is loose and set it down. Did not even bother to offer to clean it and didn't seem like she was going to document it. I had to ask for the cleaning. I was interested at looking at some earrings, but I was so appalled by the lack of customer service..they lost a sale.
