4	I love Pandora charms...the pieces are quality and they clean the charms as well as bracelet anytime for free....They always have something new...the charms are not cheap...the range from $35. for basic silver to upwards of $100's for the more elaborate ones. The stores tend to get crowded especially around the holidays...it is the perfect gift (hint hint to the hubby)...but the sales associates I've encountered in Atlanta, NYC and Charlotte, NC all were patient...I did not feel rushed and they were helpful to me while choosing my charms
4	I went in looking for two clips yesterday... The staff were courteous and even helped design my charm placement after I found the clips I wanted... :) Before I left, they offered to clean my bracelet without my having to ask (which is what usually happens at the other jewelry stores I've been to)... I haven't been to any of the other Pandora stores, but I think I'll just keep coming to this one... I like it here...
1	I realize that this review will not likely stick as I created an account just to review Pandora. I walked into Pandora on Saturday evening to inquire about creating jewelry for my wife and children. As I walked to the counter, the associate and I engaged eye contact. She smiled and I began describing my desire. A Caucasian male (I am an African American Male) came to the counter beside me and the associate walked away from me mid sentence to help the Caucasian gentleman. I was astonished and could do nothing but walk out of the store in anger. I later returned to tell the manager of my experience. She was very apologetic. I asked for the owner's contact information so I could email him about my experience before resorting to social media reviews and such. The email she gave me was false. I am currently exploring all of my options to make sure this discriminatory act does not happen to another individual. To add insult to injury, I have spent thousands in Pandora stores as gifts to my customers.
