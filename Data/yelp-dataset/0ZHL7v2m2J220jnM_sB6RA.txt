5	Ryan has taken such good care of my vehicles, I couldn't imagine taking them any place else.  He does a better job than the Dealerships I have tried and at a lower price.I trust him to let me know what needs to be fixed now, and what can wait, and he does the repairs the right way not the quick way.Also, I agree with the other reviewer that mentioned that Ryan doesn't just replace parts, he fixes cars, and there is a differenceBottom line if you are looking a mechanic with a great work ethic and the skill to get the job done, I recommend you give him a try.
1	Took my vehicle there for a radiator in January.  Had to take it back June 26 to have it replaced again. Vehicle used for back and forth to work. Repair didn't last 20 miles before it was again over heating. It didn't make it back to the shop. Found out it was never test driven before he said it was fixed. Now engine blown.
