5	If you want someone that cares just as much (if not more) than you do about your goals, that will be honest, and that will work you harder than you could ever work yourself then this is the guy for you! Just schedule one appointment with him and he'll have you convinced by the end that he can get you the results that you want!
5	Landis really helped my son to get into great shape! He is easy to work with and will help you achieve your goals.  You can do weight training, cardio, strength training, bootcamps and much more.  He really helped my son not just to workout, but also helped him learn how important staying flexible is to reduce injury when he's playing football and basketball.  He will push and challenge you but he makes it fun too!
