3	A great new location! Subways is a decent alternative to the hamburger guys. At this store, they are fast, friendly and a nice group. I was very impressed with the quantity of food on the sandwiches. Clearly they aren't following the cookie cutter guidelines of how many slices go on a particular sandwich which is a nice touch. Sometimes, you have to order double meat depending how thrifty the store is, but not here. Enjoy!
5	As with many other Americans, I have been to several Subway locations across the US so do not read this review any further if you are looking for a review on the food itself. This is a service review and this particular location has taken service one step above the rest. The employees (who seem to be all male) are fast, friendly and generally seem happy to be working. We've all been to the business where employees mess around inappropriately at work, but these guys find the medium between play and business which always makes for a memorable, professional experience. In the three times I have visited, I have never been disappointed and have always walked out with a smile on my face. I will surely return!
