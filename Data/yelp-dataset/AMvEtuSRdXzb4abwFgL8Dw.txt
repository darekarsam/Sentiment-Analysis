1	Very rude girls working here ! Then We got served dry chicken and greasy biscuits  food was really gross, will never ever return to this or any other churches!!!
1	Employees are so rude here. I was waiting in the drive thru lane for at least 20 minutes for two pieces of chicken and when I got to the window I didn't get a hello, just my total. I didn't get not apology for the wait, no thank you, or have a good day. The chicken was dry and had no flavor. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
