3	Nothing much to say about this office. If you have to do business with certain offices then you have to go through security. Parking in back easy to find a spot. just turn right before you go through the tunnel on 17th ave going south.  This is not a MVD so do not go to this office for tags ok. Sometimes if you look up MVD on yelp it comes up ADOT.
1	I had such poor customer service with ADOT MVD. I felt totally disrespected and insulted. My order was placed and I never received it. I called in only to find out that they had shredded it because they could not confirm the address and my fee that I was charged basically became a donation to these criminals called the MVD without ever notifying me of the situation at all. Now I have to repay the fee and re-order. Couldn't be more inconvenient. I couldn't be more dissatisfied. And employees were not even nice about handling the situation whatsoever.
