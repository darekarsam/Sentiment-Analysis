1	The absolute WORST McDonald's location ever!!  Employees, especially management, absolutely lack customer service... enough said!  I have found them on at least two occasions to be quite rude with sass and unwelcomed facial expressions that easily provoke a customer to become irate once I get my food.  Most recently, both a manager and cashier copped an instant attitude when I questioned if my order was completed properly and accurately.  Let me get this straight... You have a problem with me question my order?  Especially after I have past experiences where I have not received the correct order?  And/or my order was filled incorrectly?  Really???Ok, then I have a solution to that issue... I will no longer be a patron at this location!  It is literally around the corner from my residence, but I will gladly drive further and forego the poor attitude, the cold French fries, and getting a wrong order!!
4	I added a star for inside appearance with cozy fire place and very clean.   Took one off for lack of sufficient parking and chaotic way to line up for the drive through.  These shortcomings are surely the fault of the developer but ...  other than that it's your typical Macky Dees.
2	Terrible customer service from the night crew, completely fudged my order and then tried to tell me I was in the wrong. The young woman in the first window was on her cell phone the entire time.
4	We can hardly avoid this place because of the kids. They know when we come to the drive thru sometimes twice on Saturdays. We get great service and the fries are always hot.
1	The drive thru takes forever!!! Literally waited about 30 minutes to get the food ! Really ?! Slowest service ever !!!!I asked for sweet and sour but got ranch instead !!! Ugh how do u get ranch from sweet n sour ??!??!Ordered an oatmeal and there's no spoon !!!! How do u expect to eat it ? With my fingers ?!?
