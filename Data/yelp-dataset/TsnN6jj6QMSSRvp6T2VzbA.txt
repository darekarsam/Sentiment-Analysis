5	I just picked up 4 pairs of shoes that needed soles, heel tips, and  toe tips repaired... I am so excited my shoes look like new! Fantastic workmanship, friendly staff and very reasonable prices! Two pairs are my absolute favorites that I thought about trashing and now they look new... Check out Michaels shop, Highly recommended!!
1	RIP OFF!!  Took a pair of my shoes in for soles and heels . $ 45,00. Is the a lot, I don't know. I asked the owner if perhaps he could do better. Between my wife and. I I can bring a lot of business especially since you are new to the neighborhood. His reply : I don't care that's the price. I agreed, I wasn't going to spend more time to save a few dollars. When I picked them up I was not happy with the soles. The leather was not seen straight on the sole. All he did was argue and tell me how Great he is , how much experience he has. I asked him to at least shine them since I thought he would anyway. Next thing I know  charged $6.50 for a shine and no buff additional.  STAY AWAY!!!!!
5	Quality work, done fast and the price was less than I was expecting. I won't go anywhere else. Thanks Mike!
5	Good professional store paid with credit card. He fixed two thing that I paid for and a third for free. I like his craftsmanship, his work is A+. Was expecting to pay twice the amount that I did. Hope you give him a try
5	Was in town for a vacation but my luggage suffered some damage on the flight. Someone recommended Michael's shop so I stopped by to see what he could do. Michael did an excellent job on repairing my luggage and saved me a ton of money by not having to buy brand new luggage. 5 stars for excellent craftsmanship, the friendly experience, and fair price. From his excellent work on my luggage, I would only assume he also does a fine job with shoe repair too.
5	Great work, speedy service,  reasonably priced and my shoes look better than new...THANK YOU!
