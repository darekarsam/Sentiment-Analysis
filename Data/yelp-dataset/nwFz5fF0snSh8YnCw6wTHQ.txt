1	Poor customer service! I was told 15 minutes for my personal pizza, it has been 30 minutes and still nothing. I remember why I do not come here. The wait is too much. Best to place an order literally an hour before you get hungry. Let's hope this is worth the wait.
1	Poor customer service and the thin crust taste like cardboard, no sauce hardly on the pizza and very salty. Wings are very good thou.
1	Wow. I called this place three times, only to be hung up on the first two times. Driver did not follow instructions to not ring the doorbell, but to leave the food on the doorstep but found my note AND food missing, so I called the restaurant to only get attitude from the man answering the phone for him to hang up on me twice and accuse me of hanging up on him the second time. WOW. Also told me his driver tried calling me when he was outside... never happened. Not sure why I was lied to. Never had a problem with this place until tonight. Totally done with this establishment.Clearly, I'm not the only one to that feels a one-star review is warranted. Get a clue, guys.
