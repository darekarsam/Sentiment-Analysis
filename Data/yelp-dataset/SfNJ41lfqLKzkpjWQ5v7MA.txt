5	Excellent food.  Staff are exceptionally friendly.  Great value.   Did I say exceptionally tasty food, with just the right amount of spice?   I would visit again any day.
1	Most of the food was not good. I usely go to indian restaurant and I'm satisfied but this restaurant changed my satisfaction. The rice was dry, not tasty. The dessert was out of date, we didn't eat  the dessert. On the other hand, the tea was refreshing. Me and my friend thought that the food was not cooked today but from yesterday night. They just heat the food so that's the reason the food was not good because it was not fresh. It's better to go at night and not at noon during the buffet.
