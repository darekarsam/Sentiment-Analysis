5	I have noticed this fairly new location on Kings Drive.  Today, I stopped in for a refill of the vitamins purchased previously at the Northlake store.  The clerk directed me to a corner of the store; it took me a minute to locate the vitamins.  By that time, he came over to assist.  I purchased the vitamins and some tea tree oil which is not readily available so it was a good visit.  The stores are uncluttered and there are typically  numerous selections for many if not all vitamins.
5	Convenient, staff knows their stuff and they always have what I'm looking for.
4	Knowledgable staff, a good selection, decent prices - what else do you want from your vitamin store? The staff doesn't push specific brands on you and answers questions as best they can. They're really good at leading people over to the computer for more information if they can't (legally, I'm guessing) recommend a certain product/dosage. Store is clean and organized, location is super convenient!
