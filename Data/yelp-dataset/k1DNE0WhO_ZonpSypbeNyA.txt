2	....my hair looks fine, but I swear to God the young lady cutting it was intentionally jabbing me with the sheers.
3	Nothing to rave about, but certainly worth the money they were charging. They are often busy, which means I have to wait up to an hour to get my hair cut.

5	Stopped in for a haircut and color. The staff is very nice and the girl that cut, colored and styled my hair did an awesome job. They are just as good here as a salon you might pay twice as much at. So glad I stopped in.
5	Gavin did an amazing job on my color, cut and style!  He is very kind and his work is very consistent.  There were only two employees working at the time, Gavin and Roxy.  While Gavin was busy with my color, Roxy was very calm and provided great service to everyone that came in for a cut.  Roxy was very busy and everyone loved their hair when they left!!!  You have two great employees in Gavin and Roxy!  Supercuts is fortunate to have two employees that are great with color, cuts, and styles!
