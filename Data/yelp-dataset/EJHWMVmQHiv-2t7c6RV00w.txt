4	Great place, always hit it up when I am in town.  Wait staff are cute women and always have sports on.  pub and saloon area's are great to watch games.  food is above most bar's and beer list is great.
4	Casual atmosphere. We got sat right away on a Sunday evening. The location is great to walk around after a full tummy. We had the Queen City chicken. It was filling, looked great, tastes great. I like the art in there and they also brought the projection screens down in the main dining room. Also the booths are Large. Price was also good! Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is our server was slow. But I'm sure it will be different next time
4	food is awesome. my first yelp. and food is awesome. but they got rid of the blue cheese tomatoes. so minus a star. this appears to also be a vt bar #goacc
3	Pretty solid bar and restaurant. The food isn't going to knock your socks into a coma or anything, but not to shabby.  If you utilize their nifty beer specials beforehand, you may not mind the salt overload.The staff was friendly enough and the bartender seemed like a swell fella.I brought one of my considerably less handsome and intelligent friends with me, and they did not openly mock him, or even ask why such an amazingly hot and cool guy such as myself would hang out with such a knuckle dragging mouth-breather. Kudos to the staff at Blackfinn's for making my hangers on feel almost deserving of spending an evening with me.
1	Casual atmosphere and quick seating.  Server was very mediocre in attitude and suggestions.  The night took a turn for the worst when I discovered a piece of plastic wrap inside my bacon wrapped meatloaf.  Will not be back!
