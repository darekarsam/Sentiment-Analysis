4	Dusty, low lit with a comfy couch and great selection of used books (mostly english) fiction, non-fiction, memoirs, history, cooking, travel,war, art, past exhibition catalogues...hours can be wasted,and best of all,fair prices.
5	Passed SW Swelch on the way to get bagels from St Viatur. A photography book in the display caught my eye so I went in to have a closer look. The owner is a friendly guy and we had a chat about phones and cameras. There's a good selection of what appears to be out of print and collectible books. The prices are very reasonable. I got a coffee table book for $20. Visited on 12 Nov 2013.
5	My favourite memory of this fine establishment was purchasing this book on Anecdotes of Australian Cricket History (http://www.amazon.com/Australian-Cricket-Anecdotes-Gideon-Haigh/dp/0195506022/ref=sr_1_35?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1396967540&sr=1-35&keywords=gideon+haigh)Me and the proprietor bonded over this book; Aussies have a very colorful cricket history (They  threatened with the R word - Republic - during the 1932/33 Ashes series!); and if I ever visit and ask about new books on cricket, the subject returns to this tome!Off course I am wise enough to remember the old location on St Laurent, just south of Duluth. Dont get me wrong here, being on St Viateur next to the coffee-palooza the strip has to offer makes SW Welch is perfect pit stop for acquiring books!
