5	I am due to get my braces off next Wednesday. Dr. Frost does a really great job and his staff are friendly and caring. This whole process has been a lot easier than I though it would have been. Looking forward to seeing my new smile!
1	While I am happy with the doctor, this entire office is more about looking pretty than taking care of my child. My billing has been messed up and claims submitted wrong to insurance companies. I just offered to make a 1400 payment which I was told was the remainder of my balance. They are refusing to take my child's braces off until the insurance company finishes paying for their part of the braces. My husband will be losing his job at the end of August and we are trying to get bills squared away. Now they all of a sudden are telling me I will owe over 2000 instead of the 1400 originally stated. I am not the only person who has had problems with this. The last time I was in I heard a Mom complaining they messed up the placement of her daughter's teeth because the doctor was on vacation and instead of scheduling the apt they had to wait and the kid's teeth moved out of place. I would say don't be fooled by how "pretty" you think the office is. They decorate the Christmas tree with real crystals. The money has to be coming from somewhere and it sure is not going to be your insurance companies.
4	I found frost ortho accidentally and it was the best thing to happen to me and my smile! The staff and Doctor Frost are always so patient and helpful and I would recommend it to anyone.  My brother and I both are in the process of finishing up orthodontics, and we couldn't be happier.
