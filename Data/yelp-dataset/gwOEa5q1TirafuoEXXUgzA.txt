4	This is a great little museum in Old Montreal. It is inside an old Fire station and is it made up of 3 levels of permanent and temporary exhibitions. The First floor is a permanent exhibition on 5 different stages of Montreal history. This is a very informative exhibition and I found it interesting to compare the history with the locations I know today. The other two levels are made up of temporary exhibition's on Lost Neighbourhoods- the story of three neighbourhoods that disappeared in Montreal and the other a small exhibition on the hidden Mount Royal. I spent a couple of hrs here on my own, I easily could spend more time but there is a lot of reading at the same time you could spend less time especially if you had kids who might get a little bored because it is not that interesting for them I don't think.Overall, definitely worth a look, especially if you know Montreal and at only $6 entry, not too expensive.
4	A great museum with a ton of information about the history of Montreal.  With a long and interesting past, it was great to see how the city has changed over the decades and why the city is so rich with culture.  This is a great spot to take kids because most of it is very easy to understand and children can easily get a sense of appreciation for the city.
