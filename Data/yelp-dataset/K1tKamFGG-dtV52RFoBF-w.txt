4	I had this awesome super meaty lasagna yesterday for lunch here!  I didn't even know this area of town was here...had never ventured that direction!  I ordered the Sicilian lasagna.  It had a bunch of different Italian meats and sausage.  I ate every last forkful!  The atmosphere is nice here.  I sat on the patio which was great, but inside the restaurant was even more classier.  I would be happy to bring customers or anyone else to this spot.The bill was decently inexpensive too considering the quality of food and atmosphere.One complaint would be the slow service, although our server was very pleasant...just over worked!
