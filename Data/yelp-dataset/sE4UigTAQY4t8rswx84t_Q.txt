4	Adorable extension of the Jean Talon Market providing some much needed additional outdoor seating. The Place Shamrock was set up this year, and it seems a little rickety and temporary, but I think it's proven it's sweetness and value so I hope they make it even more solid next year. There's an outdoor piano, and a wooden carousel with bikes instead of horses that only moves when you pull it by hand (because exercise!) and a bunch of rocking benches with picnic tables and planters. On the weekends there are djs and improv and dance classes and sometimes art sales and it's all kind of heartbreakingly community oriented and delightful.
4	quiet little place on the outskirt of JTM where you can just get away from the busy market on weekends. once you put foot in, its like everything else around you is dead! you are literally in another world. well, that is if there isn't something going on like an improv, dance or whatever and hopefully, the neighbor isn't blasting some music. last time i was there, they were going wild on taylor swift. not like i hate. pretty enjoyable while observing the improv thing they had going on.the one thing i'm not fond of is the car lane. it defeats the purpose, imo.other than that, like some said, you have a carousel, wooden tables and bench, piano. so you can rock an impromptu picnic with JTM next door and some good bakery nearby
2	Guys there's nothing to see or do here in the winter right now, heads up. It's just some wooden rocking chairs and a wooden carousel mouldering under the snow near the market. Looking forward to seeing what they do with this space come spring 2015!
