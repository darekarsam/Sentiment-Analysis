1	Incredibly rude people work here. I walked in just to check out their sale. Way expensive for what you get. This isn't Prada so why are their suits $450? HhhhmmmThey pretty much treated me like I didn't belong there. I guess being heavily tattooed means I must be poor. My bad, I'll just spend my hard earned wad of cash at other stores. The lady kept following me everywhere as if I was going to steal. Nice! Keep in mind, you work retail so customer service is important. Guess they didn't teach them that here.
4	Unique fashion. Very helpful staff. Small sizes, though. Quite expensive, but they do have significant sales, and their "etc" location, also in Town Square, is the outlet version.
3	I really like this store...great selections of unique items made of great quality fabrics AND they have an online store. I have clothing for here that are several years old and look brand new.  Make your selections carefully, as there are no returns, although I have gotten an exchange after I mistakenly purchased the wrong size. I don't live in the city so this is my first shop stop when I visit.
