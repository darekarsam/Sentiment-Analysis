5	It's a small, family-run Czech restaurant, that serves excellent food, imported Czech beer (Czechvar) and has friendly and excellent customer service. I had the goulash, and my dining partner had the pork's knee with sauerkraut and dumplings. The portions were generous and the food was fresh. I asked if they had fleisch rouladen and the waiter told me they had a portion left from the lunch menu of the day, so I appreciate their honesty (she could have said they did and give me some stuff left from the previous week and reheated at the microwave). My goulash was scrumptious, tender meat, spicy, like the one my grandmother in Frankfurt makes, the pork knee was great, with crispy skin and full of flavor. The place does not looks nancy-fancy, rather, it looks like any neighborhood restaurant one could find in any central Europe small city, with crisp and clean white tablecloths, wooden furniture, real china and nice glassware, even the bread came in warm and stayed moist through the meal, which means it was freshly baked. The place is quiet, with low-volume tunes in Czech, and one can have a conversation without screaming. The waitress was friendly, very courteous and even smiled....the placed reminded me of a small restaurant I visited during my last Christmas in Salzburg. I left feeling satisfied and with a smile on my face.
3	My Czech cousin loved this authentic Czech restaurant.  It is family owned with mom doing the cooking and the daughter serving.  They are fluent in Czech, French and English and probably a few other languages.  The beef and snitzel  dishes were delicious.  The tilapia was ordinary.  The atmosphere is homey and friendly.
5	Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!   The tap beer was cold and delicious.   The liver pate was smooth and tasty.  The roasted pig knuckles and duck leg was scrumptious.   If you haven't been...go!
5	This place does not disappoints....still the good service, excellent food and quiet ambience...I love it
