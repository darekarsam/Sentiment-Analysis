4	The service I received was Inconceivably Stupendous to say the least ! I highly recommend Wild Coyote. (Chad) was the best, Very informative and patient.
5	I've been a fan of this pool service since before the name changed. I can always rely on our pool guy Chad to keep our pool crystal clear even though I am pretty far from his normal service area. (I'm in Mesa.) Recently though, I was having a lot of trouble with a new vacuum purchased from my old pool service company. Chad explained the pros and cons of the pressure vac that I had versus a suction vac. I decided to convert my system to suction, and the job was done the following week on my normal service day. The new system works great and looks awesome too. I can definitely say that he gave me a feeling of confidence as far as what I was getting for my money. Keep up the good work, and thanks.
5	The service received was excellent for the price, which was a little less then the others. Chad is thorough, experienced (not just some kid with a net) and knowledgeable. Will definitely be using wild coyote again.
