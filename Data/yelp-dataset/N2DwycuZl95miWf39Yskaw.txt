4	Great little local bakery with outstanding donuts. Great cookies, danish, etc. Nice little older ladies working behind the counter. Only complaint is it closes early and first thing in the morning this place is packed with yinzers. Every time I bring these donuts for my coworkers, I look like a hero.
3	Schorr is a very good bakery that makes excellent cakes and donuts.  The staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable.  I do wish they would be open after 4 pm (hours are  Mon - Sat, 7am - 4pm). This bakery has been there a long time and it's a Pittsburgh tradition.
4	Review #200I got hooked on this bakery while living in Brighton Heights.  Now, when I drive past, I HAVE to stop.  I think this one is so much better than the sister store in West View.  I don't know why; I just like it better.The sweetest ladies run this local bakery, and they always serve with a smile.  It's usually pretty fast too!  And they're CHEAP.  Doughnuts and giant muffins for $.65.  Cookies of all shapes and sizes are delicious and cheap as well.  It makes me so happy.  Some favorites:All of the doughnuts:  Raised or cake, cream or jelly, chocolate or vanilla, they're ALL SO GOOD.  I wish I could stop and say no.  But I just can't.  The selection here doesn't go too fast.  I can usually still get one around lunch time, but if you want options, go early.Lemon Poppyseed Muffin:  They run out quick, but they're so yummy!  It usually triumphs over the doughnuts.Thumbprint cookies:  Maybe I just love the cookie, but I really like them here too!Is the cliental a little special sometimes?  You bet.  Are the hours old fashioned early to open and early to close?  Yup.  But I just view it as absence makes the heart grow fonder.... :)
