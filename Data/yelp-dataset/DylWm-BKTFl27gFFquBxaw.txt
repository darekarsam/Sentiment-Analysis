4	This place actually is "Antonio's." The lady that works here is very helpful. Clean place. would have given five stars, but beware of the sketchy tweakers hanging out around here.
5	Like this place because it's always clean and they only have big washers and you only have to run the dryer one time (often times that's too much heat). Free WiFi too, so I can get homework done at the same time. They also have tv's with sports games on and the staff are always friendly.
3	Second time using this laundromat because since my washer died. There is no supervision from parents or the staff which is annoying to me because the lady working here walks past this kid who's running on the counters. The mother doesn't care. Otherwise the laundromat is clean and efficient. Not enough carts.
