5	Thank you so much! My house looks like a whole new home. The painters were extremely professional, came on time and did an amazing job. They got my whole 1900 sq ft, two story home finished in two full days. Great experience, I definitely recommend to anyone looking for painters with great quality and amazing prices!!
5	These guys just painted my condo (interior) and I couldn't be more impressed.  The price was fantastic and the work impeccable.   I used a variety of accent colors and they did a great job on the seams.  I couldn't be happier.  Thanks, guys!
5	I would highly recommend J & M painting.  I'm keeping their number saved in my phone for all future jobs!  They were able to paint my interior rooms on a very quick turnaround, and completed the job efficiently and effectively.  Thanks so much!
