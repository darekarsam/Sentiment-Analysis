4	Try to come in the morning or evening. N e other time the place is packed and sometimes it's hard to get in.  If you live in Charlotte and work in this area (Carowinds Blvd. or nearby) make it a part of your stop to get the best deals on gas.  Right down the road once the state lines crosses back over into North Carolina the Shell station (on the corner of S Tryon) is at least $0.20 more.Also, keep in mind that in the summer the place can get packed out b/c of all the visitors coming across the street from Carowinds getting food and snacks at the store and the Wendy's that's right next door.
3	This Circle K is on the corner next to Carowinds and is a distributor for Shell gasoline products. It also shares a structure with Wendy's, so there is a lot of coming and going traffic.Decent pumps and the receipt printer works. It's in South Carolina, so you're saving a good 21 cents a gallon in state gasoline tax too.I've switched to this station instead of the Kangaroo across the street because they are both priced the same, but this one is a member of the Fuel Rewards Program, so you're going to be saving at least an additional 3 cents a gallon.
1	I could not use the pay at the pump feature with a credit card. I tried twice and eventually had to hang up the pump and drive away. The display screens were cracked , and practically unreadable in the sunshine. There were pumps that were out of order. I will not be stopping here again for gas even though the prices were cheap. That doesn't do you a lot of good if you can't pump the fuel.
