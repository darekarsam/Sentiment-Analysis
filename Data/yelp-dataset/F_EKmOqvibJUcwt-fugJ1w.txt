5	This is a great knitting shop!  Good selection, knowledgeable and friendly staff.  I felt comfortable the minute I walked in. The owner is FABULOUS!  While I was browsing, a customer came in who had made a mistake and was given lots of good advice as to how to fix it.  To me, it doesn't matter how good the selection is, it's the customer service and the personal touch that matter. I love this place and I know I will be back.  The yarn selection is really nice and the quality is great.  I found yarn that I have only read about in magazines or online.
5	I stumbled into Knit Las Vegas about 4 months ago and I have to say in the 2 1/2 years of living in Las Vegas it has been one of the best finds of comfort for me.  Christine - the owner - is absolutely a delight she is so knowledgeable and fun loving.  She welcomes all and has insight for everyone even when she has 6 customers needing her attention all at the same time .The other great is the variety of people who frequent the shop to stop in to say hello or to work on their projects.  No problem will go unsolved - I have never had a source that could assist with my crochet mishaps and now I do!  Thank you Christine.

1	I'm pretty sure this place has either closed or moved.  When I called the number listed, it was disconnected.  MY GPS led me to a strip mall but no Knit Las Vegas was in that strip mall.
