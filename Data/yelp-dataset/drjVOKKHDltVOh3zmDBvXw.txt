The team was always helpful and patient as we considered options and worked to understand the processes.  We highly recommend using Academy and Jake's team to obtain your next mortgage.  We know we will!
5	Jake and Ethan were AMAZING! We made an offer on our home and went to the Caribbean for two weeks. We did not worry  knowing we were in good hands.  We highly recommend using them for your next mortgage. Their customer service was excellent. They did superior work. The calls were always answered in a timely manner and that includes e-mails. They had great communication. We came back from vacation on Monday and closed on Friday as promised. Can't thank them enough!!!
5	Jake was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the entire re-finance process.  He made everything go quickly and smoothly. He was very detailed and kept in contact with me the entire time, even when I had silly questions.  I would recommend him and his team to anyone I know.  Truly the least painful experience I have ever had.
