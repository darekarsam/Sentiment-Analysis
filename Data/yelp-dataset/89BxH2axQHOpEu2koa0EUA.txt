3	Keenly priced with a good selection of enterprising dishes on the menu and a reasonably well stocked bar. You'd not stop in for the whole night but definitely a very good option for off the cuff dining rather than a pre-booked affair.
4	I sang karaoke in here once when it was The World, or at least I think that was its name. I'm not sure if the karaoke nights still exist, but the place has certainly been revamped to quite a large extent, and is going for the classy wine bar feel, rather than traditional pub vibe. In deceivingly quite large premises on Thistle Street, Bon Vivant has the dark and mysterious, candlelit thing going on really well. I've been in here with a few friends for after work, midweek drinks, which went down pretty nicely, and the dimmed lighting and relaxed atmosphere makes you feel nice and warm and slouchy, so you get the impression that chilling with a drink for a few hours won't be a problem. Why does it seem that in some bars it would be a problem? Hmmm, in any case, there is a good selection of wines here, plus a more than average number of champagnes available by the glass, great if you're parched and feel like a glass of fizz would fill the void, but don't necessarily want to splash your whole night's funds on a bottle.
4	Once you step into this adorable restaurant, it will remind you a romantic Parisian restaurant that is quaint yet somehow modern. Although by appearance it is very romantic with dim lighting, candles and dark wood furnishings it is a great place to meet the girls for dinner or a drink or to have a quick meal. I like the concept of this menu, a great wine/champagne menu paired with appetizers, small plates of mains and desserts (though there are few items that you can get as a main course). This way you can try lots of different dishes without committing to just one dish. I'm a huge sucker for variety and this is a great way to accomplish sampling whilst dining alone.Another huge plus is that since there are small bites, the food comes out virtually instantly. Love it! I'm usually starving so the idea of ordering and it comes out right quick is very appealing. It's quicker than a fast food restaurant.The only drawback I think to the menu is that although very tasty, most of the items are very indulgent - either deep-fried or in pastry. I know the portions are small, but when you add them up, so do the calories and fat. However, it's not say that the food was not excellent because it was.To top off a wonderful meal, the wait staff was very friendly and accommodating.
4	I was quite pleasantly surprised by Bon Vivant. As the venue for the first Edinburgh meet-up, it had a lot riding on it. We were in need of somewhere with charm, atmosphere, and buzz but not so loud that we couldn't hear all the awesome chat. All tastes had to be catered for (beer, wine and spirits) and it had to be central. Et voila, Bon Vivant!I admit I was biased that anywhere this central, on Thistle Street, was bound to lack any genuine personality or charm, and perhaps cater to the tourist-trade too much. But I was wrong, and I warmed to it immediately. It was all dark wood and candles. I like candles. The type of place you would feel comfortable sipping a malt on the rocks, reading many leather bound books, and quoting Sartre.There was a relatively large list of wines that you could have by the glass = big bonus points. I also learnt my "one new thing of the day" here. "Sirrah" is French for "shiraz". So when I ordered a glass of the "see-rah" and the barman smirked and said "oh you mean the shee-raz?" I kind of deserved it. It's fairly big inside, with the dining area up the back. The food looked really quite tasty, and it's nice to know Emily also shared my thoughts of "oh I must come back here to eat sometime!" Overall I really, really liked Bon Vivant (which means "good living." Now that's you're "one new thing of the day" learned too!) And I can certainley see it becoming a go-to for a Sunday evening dinner, glass or two of wine, or quiet cup of coffee place. It's just too cosy and inviting, perfect for the approaching winter nights. The only thing it's missing is a big, open fire.
4	Big fan of this place.I love the concept of tapas so to see a place taking Scottish produce and coming up with seasonal menus which highlight the best of it makes me smile a lot.With a good wine menu (perhaps slightly over-priced IMO) and a good combination of food this place is a winner for a number of eventualities. Post Friday drinks and nibbles = tick, Sunday Prosecco and nibbles = tick, mid-week casual date option = tick!The staff are good, know the menu and know their drinks, the ambiance is nice, the music seems to be chosen by some of the rather ecclectic staff so can be a bit hit/miss but overall a great member of the Thistle St bistro scene.Jd = happy man!!!
5	I love whisky & your May Tai!Great interior, cool drinks, best service  thanks a lot!
5	Didn't eat here but had a bottle or so of red after catching a flick :)Decor and feel of place was nice and comfy - like a sultry yet warming hug welcoming you in from the cold.Service was impeccable with our waitress being brilliant, joining us on our discussion of movies good and bad.Recommended. Will definitely revisit.
4	My visit here was very brief, just a glass of wine before heading out to dinner. I wish I could have stayed longer!!This place is incredibly cosy, comfortable, full of character and has an amazing air of romance about it. It is the sort of place you see yourself settling down for the evening with a nice wine (the choice is very extensive), some nibbles (which looked devine) and then suddenly checking your watch and the hours have flown by! A good place to come with someone special. I would totally come back here, it may not meet this over the top hollywood-style liaison I have mapped out in my mind but coming here would be a damn good start!
4	The Bon Vivant is a unique place in Edinburgh.  Tucked away in Thistle street, the place is a bar that also makes food.  There is a little restaurant area at the back.They have a lovely range of aperitif martini cocktails at a reasonable price which you can sip in the comfy seats near the front.The food is lovely, fresh and Scottish fusion I would say, reasonably priced too.I only went to that place once but cannot wait to go back.With an intimate decor, it's a great place for a romantic night or just for a drink and food with a couple of friends.  I have only been during the week but I believe the place must get quite busy at weekends.Highly recommended.
5	I've previously had the pleasure of visiting this charming little venue for drinks but last night I finally got to visit for food. Bon Vivant has a wonderful intimate atmosphere, with dark paneled walls and candles in wine bottles on the tables. Being a French restaurant the wine choice was superb and the staff are very knowledgable about finding something to your preference. I like to think it's because they've gotten to taste all of that delicious wine! Whilst the mains selection looked very tempting our table was swung over by the 'bites selection' which is very much a taster menu. Being the greedy guts that we are we all just wanted to try EVERYTHING so this was perfect for us. What was even better was that once you found something you really liked you could go on to order a slightly larger portion (sharing optional.) The menu changes often so it may not be available but I absolutely recommend the black pudding with homemade tomato relish, it's divine! And best of all the puddings come in bite size portions too so you can easily try everything on that menu too!
4	Popped in here for catch up drinks with friends. Great table service, we were never short on drinks. We ended up staying for dinner too. Tasty starters of fish cakes and halloumi. I chose the Wellington for my main and hardly a word left my mouth as I stuffed it with crispy pastry, beef and the most delicious pate topping AMAZING! The bar and restaurant were rammed, but the atmosphere was really chilled. The drinks menu was also fantastic and cheap!This is definitely on my places to re-visit when I'm in Edinburgh next!
4	We spent a lovely evening here last night, catching up with family long not-seen. I'll echo other reviews in noting that the bites are a great idea, and as a person who likes to try everyone elses food, I got to indulge that in having a selection of bites to myself. Breaded brie - too strong for my tastes, overpowering the tomato salsa that is was accompanied by; fish dumping - tasted fabulous and I could have eaten 10 more; charred halloumi with some seriously tasty (nut-free) basil pesto. The SR checked out the haggis bonbons with chipshop sauce (chipshop sauce not as good as the real deal apparently), and my nephew loved the lamb offering. For the mains... I'll admit, I was surprised. Given that the bites are truly bites, I didn't expect the portion sizes to be as big as the mains were - not massive, but solid cuts of fish and meat were on display at the table. Most of us tucked into the John Dory, which was cooked beautifully with a seared diver scallop (so tender, it was embarrassing how much I enjoyed it) and a wild salad... the nephew had the sea trout with a solid serving of mussels, and the SR had the pork belly... which disappeared almost instantaneously as it arrived. Triple-cooked Chips (cooked in veg. oil) were fantastic, and the only downside was some nasty tasting asparagus (felt like they had been burned by garlic... didn't taste right personally, but my sister and her friend both enjoyed it). Of course we had to have dessert as well, and the bite size came in handy, as I really only wanted a little sample rather than a whole dessert of the chocolate and raspberry tart... and the richness of the dish really meant that bite size was more than enough for me. I think the only downside is that while the waiting staff were very friendly and pleasant, at times I felt pretty rushed, and while we were left to our own devices (despite being told we were supposed to vacate by 9... we left after 10), no-one really came by after dessert, so any prospect of drinks disappeared... not that we needed anymore - but it felt rather like a feast, then a famine. Otherwise, loved BV, liked the restaurant, would love to visit again.
4	Perfect place for a romantic date!  Didn't have dinner here (ate next door instead) but had a few pre-meal cocktails each and really enjoyed them!  The room is dimly lit, and there are comfortable chairs and candles throughout.  The atmosphere is cozy and intimate.  I had a glass of champagne first, from their very nice selection.  All their champagnes are dry - I had the sweetest one and it was still barely sweet at all but still very nice.  My next cocktail was basically an elderflower gin and tonic which I loved.  The last cocktail I had was something called the Dutch Courage (I think, can't find the list online) and it was my least favorite.  A strong orangey flavor in there that was a bit too cloying for me.  My boyfriend enjoyed his masculine cocktails and we both nibbled on tasty olives.  Though beware, the olives come literally in a bowl of oil - when you bring one up to your face, it will drip - on your trousers, as he learned!  The cocktails are indeed presented beautifully, with interestingly shaped ice cubes and clear precision from whoever is behind the bar.I will say that we hoped they would be a bit stronger.  Two cocktails and champagne for me, three cocktails for him, and we both felt barely buzzed.  Not that the point is to be drunk, of course, but you know...would've been a plus!  But I suppose the good thing is that you can come and try lots of cocktails without being on the floor!  Prices were better than I thought too - champagne was pricey per glass but many of the cocktails were only 4 or 5 pounds.Would return anytime for a drink and a snack!  So glad my friend told me about it as we could easily have walked right by!
5	Cosy, atmospheric & lovely!We ordered cocktails and they were lush! Service great, although we did go in the afternoon and it was relativley quiet.We didnt eat there but would definatley reccommed for drinks!
5	ok - after my last few visits to Bon Vivant and getting absolutely plastered on cocktails and wine, time to revisit like an adult and write a Yelp review.Went here for some afternoon snacks/tapas and a few cocktails. Had the chicken nugget kind-of-things (name escapes me), as well as the mackerel (yum) and serrano ham and whitebait. All were fantastic and just what I needed to recharge.I had "The Rescuer" which was fab as well as a dram of Port Charolette to finish. Service attentive and friendly as per usual.Great to see this place is still going strong.
5	Woweee,Despite recommending people head here a bunch this was my first visit to Bon Vivant. I genuinely didn't even actually know where it is, but we were in that end of town looking for a table for 6 after some drinks with work and I suggested heading along. We were STARVING and THIRSTY.In we went and first impressions were that if you wanted a cosy drink, or to eat with friends then this was the place to be. It was a tad dark in that I couldn't see what was in the fridges, but I got over that rather quickly. The staff were really friendly and clearly really enjoy working there which is always good to see. We were seated after about 10 minutes which considering we just wandered up at 9pm on a Thursday isn't at all bad. Olives and bread ordered (tasty) and eaten, we ordered mains and more drinks. **ISSUE BREAK**My two main issues with this place1) beer - get some bloody decent beer in. San miguel is alright but a decent craft beer wouldn't have gone amis. NOT INNIS AND GUNN - you're a restaurant not a sweetie shop. Something like Cesar Augutus from williams brothers or Schiehallion on keg would have been spot on. Light, fruity, refreshing. 2) Toothpicks - get some wooden ones. The plastic ones for the olives were annoying. **/ISSUE BREAK**Now we're done with that. Food - most of us ordered a magnificent roast lamb with mushrooms and ducks hearts. Oh my word it was awesome. I don't even want to describe it as no doubt the menu will have changed, it changes daily, so just trust me when I say put their food, in you, NOW. Staff were attentive and smiley, water glasses were refilled almost scarily quickly. All in all it was an awesome venue.recommended.
2	After all the recommendations, I found this a bit disappointing. I'd been in for a drink before in the evening and the place had quite a buzz. For lunch, though, it seems dark and dingy. Anyway, the upshot is ill give the pace a second chance at some point. I can only think they had some staffing issues over the Easter holidays, as food was generally slow to arrive. Other tables were heard to complain. Our main courses eventually came and were cold, or at least the accompaniments for the venison were stone cold. Otherwise, while tasty enough, I wouldn't have said the food was particularly different or startling, despite various rave reviews. Maybe I'm missing something, but I've had far nicer elsewhere, at better prices too. Not particularly feeling the love.
3	I went in for Gin & Tonic. This was served promptly and expertly.Nothing really wrong with the place just a feeling of familiarity. I feel I've been to many places like this. Room in West End springs to mind and Tonic also. The music was a decent level and I liked the look of the menu. What else can I say.. this in not one of my favourites of hangouts.
4	Late night cocktails and good chat!We had some fantastic cocktails here and a great catch up. The inside is a bit dark and can get a bit loud but who cares with martini's and bar bites this good!? I am definitely a fan and have sent many people along. They also do some great tasting events where you can choose the wines on the list - all the details are on the boards.
3	Ok so I feel like I may get shot down in flames for saying this but I find Bon Vivant so disappointing...the first time I entered this place it was fab. Not overly packed, good service and nice drinks but since returning several times over the past few years I've left each time feeling glum after the experience. I apologise to all the diehard fans of this place but each time it was packed to the rafters, the service at the bar was quick but typically cold and rude and the cocktails really off in taste....I will no doubt find myself tagging along in the near future with some of the diehard fans of this place and I hope my mind will be changed but for now I'd rather try somewhere else :-S*Don't worry diehards, if my mind does change I'll update my review ;)
4	A great please to pop into for a spell on an unseasonably warm day in Scotland. Nice bites and good coctkails.Haggis and fish croquettes were delicious.
4	This place is known as 'The Bon' I believe, among its loyal clientele. It's warm and friendly, a little pretentious but self confident with it. I probably showed myself up with my ignorance of cocktails, their ingredients, serving paraphernalia, names and sizes, but a drink was ordered and a drink was drunk. Sadly my cocktail didn't come in a small metal bucket, but my fellow drinker's did so I was at least able to enjoy that vicariously. (Mine was in a glass that reminded me of something my socially aspirational gran would have had in her sideboard. It was called an 'Elderflower Gimlet'. (The drink that is, not the glass. Or my gran: she was call Win. 'Elderflower Gimlet for the Win'?))3.5 stars would perhaps have summed up my sense of ease in the place, but we'll go the four because it was a birthday celebration, and the bar tender and waitress were both very kind. I drink cocktails even less frequently than I have hot drinks (combined totals in 2013: 3 thus far), so giving more stars also means I got better value for money, right?I shall be back, but it'll take a birthday to get me there I suspect.
3	The first time I went it was too crowded, so I left and returned a few weeks later. It was on a Sunday night and was nice and quiet. The service was really on to it although the particular server didn't seem super confident in knowing the wine we asked about she recommended the one we were looking at and it was delicious. We ordered the lamb appetizer, which did take a wee bit of time to come out considering they weren't busy, but it was tasty when it arrived. I can get what some other reviewers mean but them being a bit cold, the bartender didn't greet us and seemed out out when I asked for a wine list, but the girls serving were nice. I will come back and try to have another go as I do love wine bars and it is a nice place to bring friends.
4	A fabulous cocktail bar right next to a cool bottle shop. From the outside it looks plain and you can easily miss it. Look for the blue doors and walk into a low lit bar with lots of places to sit and or stand and sip a cocktail or few. The menu is extensive and there are a few bearded bar tenders mixing up a great variety of cocktails. There are cocktail specials on the boards and an extensive cocktail menu. They do serve food here however as we did not eat here cannot comment on the food. The crowd is generally a little bit older and probably over 25 rather than under. I would happily come back here for an evening with friends and spend a lot of money trying different cocktails. It's not cheap but well worth the money. The service is excellent and they even replaced one of the cocktails on a mere notion that it did not taste right. They did go our of their way to please and that is always a hallmark of a good bar.
4	Popped in for a couple of drinks. Nice friendly atmosphere and great to get table service for drinks.
4	I actually had my wedding dinner at The Bon Vivant! Even though I had never been before I had to trust my now husband's word alone and I'm so happy that we went with it! BV managed to have something that appealed to everyone in our party including my side of the family who are *very* fussy eaters. Not only that, they were all trying (and loving) each other's food! So massive success there!As for drinks- let's just say I had plenty of cocktails before the meal that evening. They were all outstanding and delivered quickly.The staff were absolute stars. Polite, friendly, attentive (but not OTT) and calm throughout the busy evening. Our wine glasses were always full and we were never made to feel rushed.I can't wait to go back as soon as possible and try everything out again on a much calmer day and to update this review with specifics.
5	Everything was superb. I tried four mini-appetizers, a pasta/rice main and a dessert. I also had a nice glass of white burgundy.  A few of the appetizers were fried (spring roll and samosa) but they were not too hot to eat, nor did they shatter. They were both fried just right as to be crispy.  The harissa and pork belly were also both excellent -- maybe slightly salty on the harissa.Compared to other nearby restaurants I tried this has much nicer and more modern food at a similar price, so the value is definitely superior as well.
