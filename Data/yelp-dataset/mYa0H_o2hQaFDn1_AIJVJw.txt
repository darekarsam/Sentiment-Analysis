1	I've been here twice to check out the facility.  Each time as soon as the door opens, I'm blown away by the overwhelming smell of urine and explosive diarrhea.  This entire place needs to be doused in bleach.  The staff is terrible.  I can't put enough emphasis on "terrible"  they are rude, they don't care and if they treated me that way, I can only imagine how they treat their patients when no one is looking.  There is one nice person that works here, Deshawn, she is the receptionist at the front desk and a total sweetheart.This is the third Life Care Center in Phoenix that I've encountered.  They are ALL terrible rehabilitation facilities, they all smell the same and have the same careless staff.  If you care about your loved one that needs to recover from a surgery, DO NOT put them in a Life Care Center.
5	Always great staff starting with the receptionist who presses the button to open the door for me in the front, to the social workers and nurses who work effortlessly to see the patients get the best care possible, and to the therapists who get the residents on their feet again.  This is one of few nursing facilities i would send my own parents to.
