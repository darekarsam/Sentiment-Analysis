3	This store is smaller than the PetSmarts, however they carry a great variety for a few dollars cheaper. Staff seem knowledgeable and were very helpful.
4	Tired of PetSmart ? Give this place a try. Ok, the prices are just about the same, but they do have a cool selection of items not seen at the big box stores. I think most pet stores seem to price-gouge on their products and I seem to find very much similar products at Walmart for cheaper.The birds, rabbits, hamsters, and other rodents are more "hands on" than the other stores,  meaning they're not stuck behind plexiglass and are given more of an open air venue. They even have a beautiful parrot who hangs outside of his cage and loves to perform.  Fish tanks are clean, clear, and plentiful. We saw no "floaters".This store is very well organized and CLEAN!!! Usually pet stores of the "mom-n-pop" variety are dingy and smelly.  Staff are very friendly and accomodating.This location used to be at the corner of Idlewild and Independence but moved down the street on 74 near the Nissan and Honda dealers, on the left heading east. Blink and you'll miss it.Your pal,Walter
4	Pet Supermarket is a great alternative to your big pet stores. I feel they have the same selection but everything is easier to find. The store itself is located on Independence Boulevard in the old Edwin Watts Building. I have been in the store a couple of times now and the staff has been very friendly and helpful. Pricing does appear to be a little higher then Walmart's prices but I find this store to be much easier to get and you get in and out a lot faster.
