4	Every now and then I order from St Hubert. The food is healthier than most other options and it is really tasty. The delivery service is quick and the price is somewhat reasonable.
4	Good food, affordable prices , good for kids, they enjoy their time especially when a clown is present. All chicken dishes are are fresh as expected from a rotisserie. I would liked their portion to be bigger. My wife enjoy their deserts, honestly amazing . All in all good place to visit with family.

I would liked their portion to be bigger. The traditional dishes are always good , however some of innovative / new ones are complete failure ( no taste or combination that does not work together). Service is usually good and fast, however we tried it on a friday might and dishes tool forever as restaurant was packed ; despite  this stuff were always friendly and helpful. Recommend it for casual lunch /dinner and fir families.
