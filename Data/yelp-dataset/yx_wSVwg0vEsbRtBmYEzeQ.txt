5	I called Airwork to see if I could get an intro flight on the same day.  The person I talked to (I think his name was Mike) rearranged the schedule to fit me in.  When I arrived I was welcomed with everyone being friendly.  We spent about a half hour going over the flight controls and a preflight.  Then we went to FLY...It was AWESOME. My instructor, Matt, let me take the controls and fly almost the entire flight.   Truly a once in a lifetime experience, especially in Vegas....I tell all my friends "I flew a helicopter in Vegas" and no one believes me.  Luckily they let me take pictures...Great company, great people, I will be back.
5	Very friendly, cheap way to earn how to fly a helicopter.
5	I came to this company to learn to fly the Schweitzer 300C with a Certified Flight Instructor named Mike Neal.  The administrative paperwork was intuitive, the aircraft was in good condition, and the flight training was excellent.  I would definitely recommend.
