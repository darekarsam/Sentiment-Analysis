4	The most southerly station in Uptown (inside the I-277 loop), Stonewall is closest to the Bank of America stadium. If you're headed back from a game, I recommend walking a few blocks north to Third Street because you'll have a much better chance of actually getting on board one of these very crowded trams.Stonewall is a slightly elevated station (as opposed to one of the ground level ones). As with all LYNX stations, there are ticket vending machines on both the Uptown and I-485 platforms. Benches underneath some cover, but I wouldn't want to be waiting out here long!This is not a "Park and Ride" station.
5	I think this Lynx Station is very under utilized since it is right at the edge of uptown.  It is convenient to the Westin and probably doesn't get as much traffic as 3rd/Convention Center because of the 3rd/Convention Center stop.  Only really had to use this station, because I felt like walking more in the evening, but the weird stair system next to the Westin to get to the platform is a bit of a maze, but the relief you get after finding the platform is worth it.  Then the feeling that you are going to get attacked like the scene from Blade Trinity with the teenage vampires (only I am not Jessica Biel and I don't have an awesome UV light bow weapon)... but it goes away pretty quickly (or doesn't show up at all, if you aren't me).I'm sure once the city builds up even more, this station will be utilized more, but for now it looks like the occasional Duke employee and chumps like me will be using this location - It also could be a possibility that I just don't take the train at the right time so I don't really see the full Stonewall exodus of people at the right time.
