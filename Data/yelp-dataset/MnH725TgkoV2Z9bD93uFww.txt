5	I bought this tour as a birthday gift for my husband and I must say that while I thought it would be cool, I had no idea it would be an educational, cultural and adventure experience. Our Captain, Rob, is a skillful pilot and very knowledgeable about the area, history and geology of the area that we flew through. It was extremely exciting to fly through the canyons and the water landing and take off were incredible. As someone who lives in Arizona, we have so many hidden jewels that we don't seem to learn about. This is definitely one of those incredible AZ experiences.
5	I got this ride as a christmas gift but put off doing it until the gift nearly expired.  I'm a private pilot and I've flown through the Superstition mountains a few times(though I never landed on the water) so it kind of didn't seem all that exciting to me.  Boy was I wrong!  Rob, the pilot, gave me a new appreciation for flying that route.  Its a great and exciting way to see the canyons and lakes of the east valley and do something few people ever experience.  If you think you've seen it all around here, check out this tour.
