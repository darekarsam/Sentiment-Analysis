5	She is a great family practice doctor.  Whenever I needed to get in to see her, they always worked me in that day...which in my experience is almost unheard of with most practices in Phoenix.  She is very nice and easy to talk to.  She listens to what you have to say and I never felt like I was being rushed.  I would highly recommend her if you are looking for a doctor in the North Scottsdale area.
1	I've been going to Dr. McMahon, now Dr. Fontius,  for a couple of years now mostly just for a wellness checkup.  I called yesterday to make an appointment for a wellness checkup and was asked what kind of visit would I be requiring.  I said a wellness checkup for a physical, blood work and prescriptions that I need.  I was told that the insurance company's don't do that anymore and that I would have to make separate appointments for what I needed.  I called my insurance company, Blue Cross Blue Shield and was advised that they do not require separate visits and that is up to the individual Dr.  Obviously Dr. Fontius is scamming her patients.  First off, I can't afford the time to go back for extra visits and I can't afford the copayments.  So I say to you Dr. Jennifer Fontius, think things over because you're going to lose your practice.  Sorry that I had to do this, I'm not one for slamming people but this time I just think this is wrong.  Remember your oath!!!
5	Jennifer is absolutely amazing. She is a sweetheart. She always goes out of her way to make sure she has everything taken care of for you. She is also very well at prescribing the RIGHT medication for you and not just grabbing her pad and med-ding you up!I've gone here for almost a year. The front desk lady, Nancy is a complete sweetheart  as well. Always leaving me the cutest voicemails if I don't answer. Great positive vibe here. Everything is run smoothly.
