5	It's odd reviewing a mortuary "Woohoo!" but I'm compelled to convey how much I appreciated Tempe Mortuary and the service they provide.  My mother's funeral service was personal, touching and the personel professional as well as compassionate. They are family owned and treat your family member like they would treat one of their family members.
5	I know this is kind of odd reviewing a Mortuary but I have to say Tempe Mortuary has been the most compassionate, caring place They have treated my family with such respect and love. Thank you for making this experience very easy on my family and caring for us.
5	My family liked the idea of working with a locally owned business for my Mother's funeral.  While Mom was in hospice (Hospice of the Valley is awesome), we did a little pre-planning which was helpful.Doug and the entire staff at Tempe Mortuary were very helpful and patient.  Every detail was taken care of and wishes honored.  The visitation and rosary was nice and Mom looked great.  They took care of organizing the flowers, pictures and we also did a slide show.  We often had questions and they were always helpful in answer any and all questions.  The day of the funeral went just as expected, there was great coordination with the church and the cemetary.  Tempe Mortuary made a tough time much easier.
