5	Went here last week and the guy working the drive through was awesome! We always have liked going to this location since its close to the Mesa Temple (a nice spot to walk that ice cream off) but now we love it even more! Only draw back is that it is in the middle of construction so it's really hard to get to.

Conveniently located next to the LDS Mesa Temple for all your youth baptismal after-temple treats, date nights, and when you just gotta satisfy that sweet tooth.
4	By far the best thing I've ever had from DQ is a flamethrower burger with onion rings and extra flamethrower sauce. My heart is racing just typing this!
