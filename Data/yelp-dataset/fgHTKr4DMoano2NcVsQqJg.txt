4	This place recently opened, it didn't take long for them to open their doors after Poblano shut their doors. Have been here a few times, and really enjoyed this place. My favorite is their Mexican Steak Burger, it's your usual burger except has added chipotle sauce, pepper jack cheese. I have had their sonoran dog, first time I ever had one and really enjoyed it. Glad they open this place up,
1	If i could give this place zero stars,or negative stars i would.i have only been there once before and had the carne asada burrito.the meat was over cooked and dry,so they must have though they were fooling me by dousing it in oil.today i had the 2 chicken enchiladas,rice,beans,and 20oz soda for $5.69 (Wednesday special)..everything tasted straight out of a can.beans,rice,and especially the bland enchilada sauce.there was a few strands of shredded chicken in the enchiladas,but most of it was filled with green chiles and some other stuff.i finished the meal after putting a lot of salt and their watered down red salsa.took  me a whole 4minutes to eat it all.i was still left with an apetite but refused to spend more money on food there.i should have opted for a liquid lunch (beer)i will not be returning.
2	The food was pretty good, but nothing makes up for being shortchanged. Unfortunately,  the bill in question was already in the cash register and the drawer was closed before I even knew what happened, so there is no way to prove anything.
