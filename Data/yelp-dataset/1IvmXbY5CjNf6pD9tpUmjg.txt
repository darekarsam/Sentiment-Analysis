2	This 7-Eleven is on my way to work. I have stopped in a couple of times to get a Red Bull or other convenience item. It's in a pretty bad neighborhood, and I always feel kinda scared going in.
3	I have bought gas here twice after visiting the amazing Jewish Deli in the same parking lot. We are from OC so we don't know the area. It definitely SEEMS sketchy. I probably wouldn't be comfortable at night. The gas always makes my car go, and it's CHEAP, so I can't complain too much. Neighborhood is pretty ghetto, though.
1	This place has a line always very ghetto the employees are slow and curse .....very very unprofessional bums outside and I feel like im shopping at a second hand corner store
