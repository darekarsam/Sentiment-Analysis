5	Excellent Pizza in Charlotte!
5	This is one of the best pizza places in Charlotte. Why Not never disappoints. Not only is their pizza good, but their sandwiches are amazing too.
5	Best Pizza that I have been able to find since moving to NC 8 years ago from MD. Truly NY style Pizza. I cant wait to taste their other offerings.
4	I got a pizza and two slices to go.  I gotta say, the slices are huge and the taste is great. I found the staff to be very friendly. Unfortunately, this place has no personality and i wouldn't particularly choose this place to eat in.  Their large pizza is a huge 20 inch monster that would last for a couple days, so the small 16 inch pizza is the one we choose.
