5	Wonderful salon!!! Love it me and my mom are in love with this place!! Cece and kim are so awesome and tony is a hoot!! I definitely recommend this place to all my friends and family and fellow yelpers!! Make sure to mention you found it on yelp!
4	This is a great nail salon!! The staff is soo sweet & friendly and the atmosphere is great. They either are playing a movie or good music on the TV which I like. The salon is very clean and well kept. They give a hand & back massage with your nail service that goes above & beyond the norm! The only reason I deducted 1 star is bc whatever brand of gel polish they use does not last well on my nails and chips fast, so I don't get a gel mani here anymore. Other than that this place is wonderful!
4	Don't let the lack of reviews steer you away! They do a wonderful job on your nails and are very detailed oriented. There is a bit of a wait time but that can easily be resolved by setting up an appointment. The staff doesn't talk very much but they are quick and try to be as gentle with your nails as possible.
5	After my old favorite nail salon changed owners the service was not up to the standards of the previous owners.  I dreaded the thought of trying salon after salon until I found the right one.The nail goddess smiled on me and I found this place on my first try and have felt no need to look further. The ladies who run this salon are lovely skilled and knowledgeable.  Each time I have come here I have felt welcomed and appreciated as a customer and not just another pair of hands.If you live in the area I would definitely check it out.
4	Really pleased with my nails. Inexpensive too! Don't let the little reviews fool you. It's a cute little place and will recommend to all my friends.
