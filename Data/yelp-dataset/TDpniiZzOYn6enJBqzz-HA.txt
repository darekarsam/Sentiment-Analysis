5	My wife goes to Dr. Henry every 6 weeks for foot care, and I have been a patient of his when I needed minor surgery once.  He is top notch.  He is also a very personable guy!If you need podiatric care. I'd highly recommend you give him a try.  He is very good!
5	I had to see Dr. Henry for a more important problem.  I broke a bone in my foot and he performed the surgery that ended up with me having a pin in my foot for six weeks.  I appreciate his expertise and I'm glad I came to a specialist instead of going to an orthopod.  This man knows feet.  His personality is first rate, too.  He always has a smile and a hearty laugh.  I recommend him highly!
5	I spent almost a year treating with a podiatrist and an orthopedic surgeon with DOC. Still had issues with my right foot.My wife referred me to Dr Henry.  After the first X-ray he knew exactly what was wrong and how it needed to be fixed. Had the surgery and I'm 2 weeks from being out of the boot. Feeling great. Finally getting things fixed is a relief. As a side note he could have been a plastic surgeon - the scar on my foot is hardly notable after12 weeks.I would not hesitate to recommend him -  great doc with a great staff.  It's always a pleasure to go and see my progress.  He will take the time to explain what's wrong and has a good sense of humor. Two offices -  Green Valley and in NW Las Vegas.
