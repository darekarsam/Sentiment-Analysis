5	Stephanie has been cutting my family's hair for years and does a fabulous job!
5	Stephanie is the ONLY person I let touch my hair. She has been my stylist for years after she fixed the mess of a terrible hair cut from a salon that will remain nameless.
5	Angel is amazing! Called to make an appointment and got me in right away. Got a cut and color and conditioning treatment. My hair looks beautiful. Already received tons of compliments and its so soft. Great experience and looking forward to my next appointment.
5	Living in Scottsdale, AZ now and was looking for a great salon and stylist near our old town loft. Was lucky enough to find Angel Martinez. Yesterday I had cut, color, style and conditioning. When I walked into a holiday party last night my friends immediately noticed my amazing highlights and style! The great thing about Angel is that he listens to his clients, adds his own ideas and expertise, has a great demeanor, and has the skill to bring a beautiful outcome. He will definitely be my first call in the future. The shop is in an upstairs location, so look up when you reach the building. Great job Angel! Everyone in the shop was friendly.
