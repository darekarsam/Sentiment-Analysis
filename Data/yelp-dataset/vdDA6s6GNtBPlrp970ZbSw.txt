4	Clothes are always cleaned with no yucky chemical smells.  They have also worked miracles on clothes stained with red wine! The owners are very friendly and welcoming.
4	I have been a loyal customer for the past 10 years.  I bring all my clothes here and they know me by name and treat me and my clothes very well.  I like the fact that the clothes are cleaned on site, not at some massive factory.  The employees are friendly and accomodating.
1	I saw great reviews so I thought I would try themPro'sGreat location and same day serviceCON'SThey charge an EXTRA 10% for same day service and tax on that 10%.  I have used many dry cleaners in 30 years and this is a 1st.  SAME DAY SERVICE is a normal service for dry cleaners.  They offer a 20% discount for early birds but with their prices being so high it just brings them to still higher than anyone else in the area.  Maybe because they are in Piper Glen they feel they can over charge.   I hope the quality of the service is worth the HIGH prices.  Time will tell
1	I was promised a suit and shirt cleaned and pressed by 5pm today. I showed up at 5:20 and the woman working took 10 minutes to find the suit, then informed me that she lost the accompanying shirt. She finally dug it out of the bottom of a bin, extremely wrinkled, then looked at me defensively and said that it was not her fault. I told her I didn't care whose fault it was, I wanted my items and I wasn't paying for a job not done. She looked at me and yelled, "you know what lady!!!!! You are wrong!! I don't like your attitude!! Take your things and get out." Which I did. Needless to say, I won't be back. I wouldn't take anything here I cared about because who knows if you'll get it back.
