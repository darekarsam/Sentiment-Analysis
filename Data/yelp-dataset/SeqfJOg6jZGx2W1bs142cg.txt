5	This is my favorite Papa John's location in Phoenix! Fast, friendly, and ALWAYS yummy!
4	We go to this Papa John's all the time. Service has always been quick and friendly. The one time they messed up the order, I called and they immediately gave a coupon for a free pizza to make it up.IMHO Papa John's is the best chain pizza out there - much better than Domino's, Pizza Hut, or Little Caesar's (although any pizza is always good).The only drawback is that delivery can take up to 45 minutes and since the store is less than 10 minutes from my house, I always do carryout.But, if you're in the area and craving pizza, I recommend this Papa John's.
2	Yikes! Cold pizza when I called in the guy on the phone just acted totally confused & as if he was not responsible in the slightest. $50 of gross! Not ordering from this location ever again. Staff is clueless!
3	I've had pizza from here a few times now, and its pretty good.  I've ordered online twice and carried out once, and two of the three times, the pizza was really good.  The one time I carried out the pizza tasted a bit undercooked. It just didn't taste right at all.The staff here is friendly, and the delivery times are fairly quick.  In regards to the competition, I have to say, Papa John's ranks a bit higher then the others.  It's not the worst pizza I've , but I actually kind of like it.  I will probably order from them again, and their food isn't half bad.
5	WONDERFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! Everyone was sooo nice and helpful!! I will def come again!
