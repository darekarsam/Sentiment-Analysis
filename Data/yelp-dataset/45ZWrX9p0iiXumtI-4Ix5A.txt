5	This just opened and I had never been into a Hi-Health, so I was amazed at all the Nurtrition/Supplements that are available! The staff was great at answering all my questions  - 5/5 stars! I was also very impressed with how knowledeable the staff was - and patient with me in my quest to find a healthy way to loose weight --- just a few pounds, I promise!Great idea putting this right next to our local grocery store area. Will make it very convenient to use in the future!
5	amazing service, i asked some questions and was explained the plus and minus of the different options, I will go back anytime i need a boost
5	Went in to buy a drink yesterday. Ended up walking out with two for free! Brandy helped me out and has before. The staff at this Hi Health are always helpful and super courteous.I went in another time to buy a protein bar and when asked if I was looking for something specific I thought there was no way the cashier would know what I'm talking about. I explained that I was looking for something with a low glycemic index and she pointed me to a few that had mostly meet fiber carbs.. therefore being low glycemic. I was pretty impressed. Knowledgeable staff here. Thanks guys.
