4	Brewers Hotel is an excellent dive spot for cheap drinks, located between The Strip and Bloomfield/Lawrenceville on Liberty Ave. It is not a hotel in the traditional sense, but there are extended stay apartments above the bar which I imagine are mostly let out to folks in transition. Historically, Brewers' was dedicated to supporting people with AIDS and they continue to subtly promote prevention of HIV/AIDS. There is absolutely nothing obnoxious or outrageous about this gay bar; it's just a super chill place to enjoy a drink, smoke and/or video game (on one of those crappy bar consoles). On Tuesdays they have free pool and $3 pitchers. Our draft Straubs on a normal night were $1.75 each. Expect drunken characters and adequate, if not friendly, service. Predominantly older male crowd, but a welcoming/indifferent one. If you are feeling generous and quirky, bring along pig paraphernalia to leave behind for the barkeeper.

2	Eh, so just to say upfront that I've only been here once and I would want to go back again- except I probably won't. Gay bars are always hit-and-miss, but after hearing a bit about this place I decided to stop in one night. Total dive bar, pretty smokey, pool tables in the back. It seemed that most people knew each other, which is great. The drinks were cheap and for the most part the bartender and the other people were nice and respectable. However, I unfortunately had a bad experience with a regular who just wouldn't leave me alone. And his friends and the bartender shrugged things off as nothing, which made me a bit uncomfortable. I finally decided to leave, and it is because of this and this reason alone that I will probably not be going back here. It's a shame, because I love me a nice blue-collar dive bar.
