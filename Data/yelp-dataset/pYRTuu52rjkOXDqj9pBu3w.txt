4	They were very helpful yesterday, not just for me but with all the other customers. I came in to get some flyers printed up regarding my lost dog. They gave me previews of the b&w vs the color. They were all very helpful. There was a short wait in the checkout line but it gave me the opportunity to watch them with other customers. The female cashier gave them a very helpful description of how long they would need their Staples card until they would be in the system. She gave them the rundown of where to find specific needed information when registering their new printer and a basic step by step of how to install. Nothing she did was unnecessary or made the wait very much longer. They opened up another register to get other customers through and the managers were not impossible to find as they were out helping customers on the floor as well. I was very impressed with the customer service at this location and if you have any questions regarding copying or cropping, they can definitely do for you anything within their means.
