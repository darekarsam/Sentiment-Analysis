4	Good selection of merchandise.  They will typically carry anything you need or want, including rentals...a little bit on the pricey side though.  They do take competitor coupons though.
3	What happened to the today's you actually got help in the store. We just wandered looking for items and no one to help.
5	I love this store! The management is terrific! The staff is terrific and I especially love the Bike department. I have brought some old bikes in for repairs, tune ups and parts. Every time I visit the store, I am greeted with respectful and courteous staffers. With three kids and me being a bike enthusiast, I am very happy going there. I recently bought my son a bike for Christmas from Sport's Chalet. The tire was flat while the bike was on display. The tech filled and it seemed fine. By the time I gave my son the bike for Christmas, the tire was flat again. I brought the bike in the day after Christmas and they filled it with air and mentioned if it went flat again, they would replace the tube. Well, this morning we wanted to go riding and the tire was flat. I called the store, the manager said bring it in and they will fix it on the spot. I brought it in, they fixed it and we went riding. Great store, great customer experience. I highly recommend them!!.
