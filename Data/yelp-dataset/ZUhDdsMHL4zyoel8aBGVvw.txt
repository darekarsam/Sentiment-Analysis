5	Had a leaky water softener.  Called them about 9am on Friday September 12, 2014.  The man said they were very busy that day, but would try to get someone over there as if possible.  He told me the leak was bad and seemed concerned about it getting worse.It was after 4pm and I figured they weren't coming that day.  I thought they would hopefully be able to make it the next day.  But, to my surprise, I got a call from Carl with Reidhead Plumbing and he said he was on the way.  I thought after 4pm, no plumber is going to start a job.  Well, he did.  And he finished it quickly.  Took out the old water softener and installed a new water softener that we had purchased.Reidhead Plumbing exceeded expectations by showing up when I expected to have to wait another day.  They did the job quickly and well. I write this five days later - no leaks or problems with the new water softener.  And, at a price that was less than the other two quotes I received.
5	My experience with Reidhead the past 3 months has been positive. I am not trusting and ask lots of questions and want to thoroughly understand. They have been patient, honest,  punctual,  efficient and flexible with payment options in my case.The Solar water heater and reinsertion pump work great! Carl and Lena have been the 2 I've interacted with the most. Both are an asset to company and has earned a loyal customer.
5	I had a problem with my kitchen sink come up where I needed the water values under my sink replaced asap and needed a new disposer put in.  I called mid-afternoon and talked to Lena who told me they were busy that day but set me up first thing the next day. Thirty minutes later Lena called back and told me they had a man in my area that could come immediately. Marshall was knowledgeable, quick and efficient, and went the extra mile by using my existing hose because my new disposer I ordered didn't come with one. I'll definitely use them again.
