4	Good location, open late, and they always have the latest and greatest menu and promotional items.  The last few times I went, they ran out of ingredients, but this is understandable given how busy it generally is in Las Vegas, especially inside of Miracle Mile. Well-staffed, well-run, clean and friendly for a busy venue outside of Jamba's home base of California.
1	Worst service, they just keep talk and talk with each other, wait for a long time for a drinks, won't be back!
1	Ugh, terrible. Bad customer service and they had run out of multiple key ingredients at noon on a Saturday. Worst of all, they weren't telling people this as they were ordering, but the person making the drinks was asking them after they paid if they would like to substitute frozen bananas for another fruit. I paid $12 for a small smoothie and a granola bar. That hurt, but at the time I had no other option. I would never go back to this location.
