4	This specialized Baby Store is everything a parent or a parent-to-be can wish for. Lots of strollers, furniture and cribs selections are to be had in a spacious environment where staff on repeated visits have more than helpful to my mother-to-be wife and I.Plenty of clothes are available for babies of all ages and many items are available for whatever need you may have.However, kindly note that for some electronic devices you're better off comparing prices for them online or at other stores as I found far more reasonable deals for them elsewhere.For example, if a baby monitor is sold here at $300, you can easily find the same one, brand new, a few blocks away for $200. They should not mark up their prices to this degree.
3	Good review, Jason. I, too, was impressed with the selection in this store, but what really struck me was that most of the prices on common items were much higher than I would have expected (and higher than competitors that are located just down the street.)If you know what you're looking for and are prepared, price-wise, Bo Bebe can be a good place to get what you need. But beware the huge markups. All that being said, I got very good, attentive service. That impressed me.
5	This is the store we go to again and again as they have very good service.  Their staff is well trained, so not only they can answer questions, they also suggest things we might not have considered or known. My husband is very tall and I am very short. So, they suggested a specific stroller where we could adjust the height of the handle. We have gone back again for the double stroller for the second baby. And received the same service. It is good to see some familiar faces.I agree with the other two reviewers about checking the pricing online if you want to buy an electronic item. They have moved this year to a bigger location on Blvd Industrial. Store is much more spacious. My daughter was happy to run around.
