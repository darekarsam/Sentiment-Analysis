2	Really overpriced, 6 or 7$ for 4 gyozas made of beans. Took over an hour to be seated even with a reservation. Ran out of 2 of our dishes and didn't even bother to tell us. Took over 50 minutes to bring our food.
2	Went to kyozon for the first time for my friends' birthday party and her reservations were at 8pm but they didn't have our table ready until 8:30pm. I mean, if we were to have reservations at the restaurant, the least they could do is tell us 8:30pm instead of making us wait. Service was definitely slow and could have been a little faster. The food was decent, it was nothing special.  I ordered the sobe sushi roll (honestly, I've had better sushi),  and the chicken pad Thai (not too bad).  What I liked most about the restaurant is the ambiance and the decor.  It looked very traditional Japanese style restaurant. Other than that, nothing too special. Someone should also ask about the kaiten belt. So this is the belt that you can grab sushi off and then they charge you afterwards depending on the color of the plate and how many plates. I didn't have their kaiten belt, but I did ask a waitress about the belt and how they ensure the food safe of the food (so that it's not just rotating around for hours without a customer grabbing it) and she had no idea and made up some reason that did not make sense.
2	Went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and the place was near empty. Sat upstairs in a booth by the Kaiser belt. Was told it was $17 per person for all you can eat sushi plus a la care items. The food on the belt was good - not great - but found the food pretty boring and unimaginative. I know it's just sushi, but they didn't have a lot of variety. I would not return.
