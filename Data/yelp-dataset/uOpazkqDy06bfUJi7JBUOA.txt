5	I'm an Apple girl. But, when my dad got his first smart phone EVER last month we received a white glove experience.From start to finish this little pop up shop near Urban Outfitters showcased patience with my dad. I was appreciative of the time, care and attention to detail they displayed. Sometimes buying a technology product can be a humbling experience but the Microsoft Store was gracious in a way that would make me leave a 5 star review.
4	Friendly staff.  Interacted with several different people and all were enthused about the products and helpful.  Glad to have this in the Charlotte area.  Being able to try different laptops without the pushy staff of some other stores is great.  Another perk is the products sold here are "signature editions" so they don't have the bloatware you might get on the same laptop if you buy it elsewhere.
1	The staff might be great if you have the time and ability to drive to the store in hopes that they have what you are looking for.  Just don't hope to actually talk to someone and get a question answered - the store will not provide any information on its stock via the phone. So if you are looking to figure out if they have a product before you go, you will have a very frustrating conversation in which someone standing in the store will not tell you whether they do or do not have something they might be standing right next to. It was an awful customer service experience and made me buy a competing product instead. Microsoft certainly isn't going to improve its reputation this way!
