3	It has been a while since I have rented a car while on a business trip.  And this was the first time that I didn't make the arrangements.  (Guess, that means I am moving up in the world.)   The process of picking up/dropping off the car was very easy.  No lines at the counter and the car was clean.  While I was glad to have a car and the freedom it provided me in Madison.  I was glad to be able turn it in (and fly home), so I could get back to my own car.
2	Avis has tenants in the parking lot to give you a receipt, Hertz does not.
5	Amazingly quick pick-up and delivery.  No pressure to upgrade (Yay!)  Couldn't be easier or more smooth.
