5	Best place to get tire! These guys are awesome! They installed my tpms sensor I bought online for under $20 when there competitor turned me away. I just had 4 new tires put on today and they had the best price plus a $75 visa gift card!
4	I recently needed 4 new tires and after researching a few tire companies, I found this place to be the least expensive with great reviews and they are super fast!  I was in and out in no time and they offer coverage if anything should happen to the tire.....sweet!
4	I've been to this location a few times now and have been well taken care of each time.  The tech's are knowledgable and willing to spend the time to explain all available options.  I arrived late for my appointment but they still got me in and out within an hour to install 4 new tires.  I've been a long time customer at Discount Tire with their commendable service and free tire rotation/balancing for the life of the tires.  We've move around quite a bit (Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, North Carolina) and there has always been a DT close by.This location is great due to its proximity to Concord Mills.  While your car is getting worked on stop over and walk around the mall!  It's good people watching at the very least.
