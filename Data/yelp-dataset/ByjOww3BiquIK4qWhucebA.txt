5	Excellent service and always very helpful.  They have fixed up a number of shoes for me and my purse.  I wouldn't take my high heels or boots anywhere else.  They are THE best.
5	This place is an absolute gem.  The two guys who work here always do a great job and their prices are more than fair.I first found them about 6-8 months ago when I needed my golf shoes repaired (the sole had become mostly detached from the shoe).  They fixed those shoes and since then I've brought them some other items to repair and shoes, boots, and bags from both my wife and me.  They have a knack of bringing back shoes from the dead and making them more than presentable...and always for less money than I expect.  I will continue to use their services as long as they are there.Could not be more highly recommended!
5	This shop is out of my way, not close to my residence or work... And I'll still make the trip to take my stuff here. They are fast, and when they ring me up I'm always pleasantly surprised how much of a bargain I'm getting for the quality of work they perform. More than confident when I drop my stuff off and more than happy when I pick them up.
