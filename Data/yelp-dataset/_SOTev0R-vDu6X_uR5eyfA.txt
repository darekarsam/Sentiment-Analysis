4	This is a good place to bring the little ones to see if they're interested. The instructors are gentle and helpful with all of the kids. They have an introductory special that gives the student a chance to try it out before committing. Apparently you can work all the way up to a black belt, as there are several older students who are doing just that. The classes are organized by age, so the students aren't paired up with someone much larger or smaller. When they're starting they mostly practice evasion techniques and some judo grappling, and only practice sparring with other students as they get older. When my daughter first started she was really hesitant, but an instructor took her by the hand and helped her feel comfortable. Now she always has a smile when she's in class.

5	After being disappointed with a karate school on the far North side, I began looking for another place to train, I happened across Arizona Family Karate Academy, and I must say... the instructors there are top notch! They take the time to work with you, to educate you, and to make you feel special. I can make up classes whenever needed, and  in the three months I've been going there, I haven't yet found them to be closed due to some family emergency or out of school function. Both Ms. Pam and Ms. Angelica are dedicated to ensure that you get the most benefit in your class. They work with you, one on one, and make sure you are comfortable during class. They genuinely care about you! I've also seen what they do with children of all ages, and I am very impressed. The school also has great specials (a "try before  you buy"), and participate in most local community activities (and NEVER need to close the school to do so!). I'm impressed and proud to be a member of this "family", and feel that I have made good friends with both the instructors and fellow students!
