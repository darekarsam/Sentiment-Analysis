1	Decent clothes, at least in my experience (I've heard stories from others about clothes falling apart within the first month), and ok prices if you're picky and get there at the right time to get what you need, but their return policy is ridiculous. I brought back a purchase an hour later with all the tags on and apparently "company policy" is exchange or store credit only.I will not be shopping at this chain again.
2	This chain rarely has much appealing to offer and the Champaign location is no different.  It's very very small and cramped, and the woman helping me (I want to say Becky? Maybe?  Blonde, mid-forties, seemingly in a position of authority in the employee ranks) REEKED of smoke.  If there's anywhere inappropriate for a heavy smoker to work, one would think it would be in close quarters with pregnant women. Their computer system is clearly antiquated and frustrating for them to use. It crashed and had to be rebooted during checkout, earning me another six minutes in the store. They did have one thing I was looking for, which was elastic pants extenders so that I can keep on wearing my pre-preg jeans!  The clothing was truly unappealing otherwise.
