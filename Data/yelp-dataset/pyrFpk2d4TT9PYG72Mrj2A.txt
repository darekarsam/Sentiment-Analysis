5	So this Bo was closest to my house, so I had to go with it, but pretty much standard for all Bojangles!  The food is super greasy and super yummy.  Come on, you have to admit you know it's going to be good when you see that grease seeping through the bag!  I always get the same thing.  "Cajun Filet Biscuit Combo, French Fries, Iced Tea" as they say over the loud speaker.  You have to get extra seasoning if it's sitting out, because the spices are the best!  And this is the only place I drink sweet tea.   I'm planning a visit to NC and Bojangle's is on the top of my list to visit!
2	Swallow Xanax, 'cuz the drive-thru is S-L-OOOO-W. Ham/egg biscuit.
1	I can only give this location 1 star.  When I pulled up behind another car to place an order, I could see there were cars lined up to get to the window.  After placing my order, it was over five minutes before the first car pulled away from the window with food.  I could see they had ordered the big box (family meal) but that's no excuse.  There were two more cars ahead of me, so I had to leave.  My daughter had to eat something else...
1	Was the slowest fast food experience ever. It was 20 min and there just to get the food.  Was at least 6 employees and only 4 in the building customers I could see.  The food was fine but they were slower then then I have ever seen. Good thing I was not in a rush. How do they not have chicken tenders in under 15 min. Even if the are frozen, they can deep fry them in under that.
