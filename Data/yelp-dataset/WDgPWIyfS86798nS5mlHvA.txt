3	I came in here at 2:30pm today. My doctor referred me here since it was short notice.  I've had these blisters on my left palm for 5 days. They HURT & are really itchy. Not sure what could of caused it haven't tried any new detergents.  Maybe from the day we were at the speedway I touched something with peanut oil from someone's hands being on the railing.  But I always use my right hand for everything. Weird how it's isolated on just my left palm. The next doctor to come in for urgent care was at 4PM, I was not thrilled with the wait time I'll admit. I was waiting for nearly 3 hours until I was seen because people kept piling in and I was the last priority since I only had minor pain.When I FINALLY met Dr. Shin was very understanding & caring. I appreciated him taking the time to ask questions about my past medical conditions very kind of him. He gave me a topical steroid & Hydroxyzine.  He said to take a picture of my hand,  if it got worse he'd refer me to a dermatologist.. We'll see.They will take Walk ins for Urgent care but if you want to see a doctor for a routine check up you have to make an appointment.
