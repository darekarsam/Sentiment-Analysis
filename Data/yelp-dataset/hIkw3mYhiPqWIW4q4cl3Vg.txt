5	New Salon where T3 used to be...some of the same stylists and a great owner. http://www.ahwatukee.com/money/article_4ea50bc2-69a5-11e2-aa86-001a4bcf887a.html
5	I moved to Arizona in August and was in desperate need for a hair stylist. a friend of mine from work recommended I go to Nancy at Vincent's hair Studio. She is seriously the best. I have naturally blonde hair and dye it a golden red and she got the color spot on! I love my color and it never fades. She always makes extra time for her clients and is the sweetest. My hair is pretty long and heavy and she always give me a cut with smooth layers that makes my hair feel light and voluminous. So cute! The salon is clean and all the staff are friendly. The owner is always present and they frequently have cookies and things brought in by employees! It adds a nice touch to make you feel like the salon has a great sense of family. The prices are very reasonable (I moved from San Diego so maybe I'm used to inflated SoCal prices). The only thing is some stylists don't take cards as payment so make sure you bring cash or checks!
5	Absolutely the only place I will go to get my hair done! Vincent is amazing and he charges a reasonable amount. Vincent's is located off of the Warner Elliot Loop and the Equestrian Trail in the shopping center. His shop is comfortable to be in, yet you feel elegant and come out looking beautiful!
