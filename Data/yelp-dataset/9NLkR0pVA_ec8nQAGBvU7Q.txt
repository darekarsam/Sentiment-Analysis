5	My dry cleaning store closed and I was looking for a new dry cleaner.  I went to couple of dry cleaners in Ahwatukee and foothills area but I wasn't happy.  Until a friend of mine told me about Ahwatukee cleaners and Alteration, I am impress by their quality and service.  My laundered shirts looks so clean and wrinkle free.
5	This team and the owner are very professional and (truly) stand behind their quality of service. I had an issue and they made sure I was taken care of with sincerity, care and speed. I am very impressed as it takes a lot to impress me. Good people, professional, courteous and knowledgeable - what more can I ask for!Highly recommended ............
5	This is MY dry cleaners and alterations establishment. I don't own it, but it is the only place I do this kind of business. I have had more than 15 items altered always with excellent work and I get  the same great service when I do my dry cleaning. The staff is friendly, courteous, and efficient. It doesn't get any better than Ahwatukee Cleaners and Alterations. I don't do business any where else...and haven't for years and years.
