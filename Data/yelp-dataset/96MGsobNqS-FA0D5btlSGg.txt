1	PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.  Once they have your credit card and deposit, they will ignore you and not return your call.  I left over 10 messages and emails because they were late to pick up my car 1 week.  I had to pay storage fees of over $200.  Maria (the owner) answers the phone and pretends she is not Maria.  Several times she did this and did not forward my messages. After calling maria with a blocked caller id, she picks up the phone and plays dumb about being late.  When you confront her, she will curse and go crazy.  She is the biggest liar i have dealt with and not very stable.  If you want to save yourself time, the headache and stress, please use a different company.
4	I hired Auto Transporters Nationwide to move my 1968 Delta 88 Rocket  from Vegas to Texas. Because of my remote location in Texas and my reluctance expand my budget, it was taking a while to find a truck willing to bring the car to me. The Delta was taking up space in my brother in laws driveway so, I decided to sell it to be done with the situation...and I canceled the transport order. There was some confusion with my deposit, but I was impressed with Maria's efforts to find a resolution.  She was persistent and helpful. My deposit was refunded and I appreciate her efforts and patience  in working with me.
1	This experience was a disaster from beginning to end.  Not only was I given someone's personal SUV with trailer instead of a multi car carrier truck as guaranteed to transport my Tesla, but the payment confusion, lack of paperwork, lies and harassing emails from Maria proved that she does not know what she's doing or how to provide any type of professional service.  Then she wrote rude and threatening emails continuously to me once problems began.  If you want a vehicle transported professionally, I highly suggest you DO NOT use this company!
