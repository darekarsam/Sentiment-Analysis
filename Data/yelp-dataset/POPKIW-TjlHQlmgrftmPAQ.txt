5	Great first experience. The man helping me order my car wash was very nice and offered to help us fix our chipped windshield. They seem to have many additional services to offer. The place was easy to navigate and clean. I would definitely make this place my usual car wash!
5	I really love this car wash in Pineville (now known as Mister Car Wash or Mister HotShine.) The people all are smiling - what a nice thing! I have the unlimited wash program where my credit card is billed monthly and I can go in as many times as I wish. Free vacuums are available.
4	I really liked this car wash. There is an attendant when you pull up, you just tell them what you want hand over your credit card and you're done. The best part...$5 wash and free vacuums! It's perfect for a quick wash. And if a quick wash isn't your thing... no worries there are plenty of other car wash selections!I would definitely recommend this place!
2	If you are from anyplace normal where you pay and a bunch of people clean your car for you then vacuum it and wash the wheels aka do all the work.  This place is NOT for you. You pay 11 plus dollars to do all the work yourself.
5	This place is great. Just got back from a long trip and the car definitely needed a wash. After going through,  the manager came up to me and asked if I wouldn't mind going through again because he noticed the bumper still had a lot of bugs on it. Then he worked on it with a brush before the second time through. I am on their unlimited monthly plan. A real deal as far as I'm concerned.
