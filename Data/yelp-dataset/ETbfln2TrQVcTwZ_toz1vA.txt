5	Good lawyer is hard to find. Period. I am glad to find an attorney who is really dedicate on their cases. I am pleased with the services and had great experience working with the attorney in their office.
1	I would do no stars if I could..worst attorney ever!!! He took my $ and did nothing for months except string me along. He didn't fight at all for me and knew nothing about my case when we went before the judge. I have never been in need of an attorney so I found him off the internet. Biggest mistake if my life. I have since talked to many others in similar situations and I am amazed at how much better their representation was. I am not one to review often but this was so bad I had to make sure others know
5	Law Office of James E. Novak; James Novak is a former Prosecutor and is a respected member of the Bar. He is nationally known for his books on DUI Defense, and determination to battle for his clients.  James is active in the Bar, and manages several legal networks on G+ where attorneys share information, and discuss topics of interest to lawyers. James is easy to work with, and he will work hard for you. I highly recommend him to you. It is a pleasure to know him, and he serves the people of Arizona well.
