5	Right beside the Atwater Market, this super awesome little shop carries the most awesome French baked goods. Ever.I went in looking to grab a bottle of water because it was friggin' 40 degrees outside and I was about to have a heatstroke if not hydrated right away. I walked out with a bottle of water and a delicious little cookie sandwich filled with a praline cream. SO GOOD I wanted to run in and grab eighteen more, but alas I was already driving back home. The store had such an incredible array of fresh baked goodies that it makes you literally want to raid it. Oh man. It was hard choosing from it all, but I'm glad I got that cookie sandwich - which I am sure has a much more proper name.Sigh.. Wont you open up a Au Pain Dore in Calgary already?
5	This little corner boulangerie gets overlooked because it's right next to Atwater Market. It doesn't have the sheer variety of breads the boulangerie there does but what they have is great and they are friendly and neighbourly. The pain aux pommes is especially impressive and they have the best straight-up basic baguette we've found in the city so far. Plus sweets, a place to sit and eat a fresh pressed pannini that perfectly replicates the Paris street experience, etc. And no giant Atwater Market line.
