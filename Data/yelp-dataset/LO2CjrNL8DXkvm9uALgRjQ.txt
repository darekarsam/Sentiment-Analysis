3	I was somewhat disappointed that I didn't find what I was looking for.  This is a fairly small Marshalls.  It didn't look like the store received the worst items around, they just don't appear to have a lot of diversity like many of the other Marshalls that I patronize.  Will I return?  Yeah, I will.  I had one item in mind that I was looking for and didn't look for very many other things.
3	If you're looking for a wallet, a new cheap purse or something of that nature--this is the place to go.Otherwise, this kind of shopping just isn't for me!I don't have the patience for clothes shopping here though.The racks drive me nuts bc they're in no particular order.Its "Shirts/Sizes", "Pants/Sizes", "Jeans/Sizes", "Coats/Sizes"I can't look through a gazillion racks of shirts looking for something I like (aimlessly) in a M or L... I just cant do it!  lolWish I could, I'd probably find some deals.PROS:Some good dealsCONS:You've gotta "dig deep" to find 'em
3	Went in here to grab a last minute item I needed for an outfit.  I wasn't going to hold my breath here either, I know it's a Marshalls and that doesn't always mean the best selection.  It's hit or miss no matter what you are looking for.This day, was a hit, maybe even a home run.  I do have to admit, the Kenneth Cole shirt I got not only looked great on me, but made my wallet feel even better!
2	Since both Marshalls and TJ Maxx are owned by the same company, I make sure to stop by both locations when shopping at the Waterfront. I generally find nothing or spend only $10 or so at Marshalls, while being enticed to spend at least $50-100 at TJ Maxx. The Waterfront TJ Maxx seems to have not only the same product as this Marshalls plus a whole lot more. All that to say, I consider shopping here a waste of time since I could just drive a block or so and be at a store owned by the same company that always has what I want and need. Sorry, Marshalls, but you're just OK to me.
