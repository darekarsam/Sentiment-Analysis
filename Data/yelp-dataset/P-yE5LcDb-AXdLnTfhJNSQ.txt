3	Easy in, easy out. As long as you want to keep going east on Fairview.Pumps have plenty of space and the station is completely covered, so you can get into the convenience store without having to step into the rain.Good selection of sodas, candies and snacks in the station but it's convenience store pricing so you're paying for that convenience. Coffee always smells good.There are two other gas stations within a stone's throw so the price is usually competitive with them. Plus or minus a penny per gallon.
4	Not too shabby.I come here only for the petro.  I do not usually have a problem with fighting for a spot at the gas station (actually, maybe twice I had to wait for a spot to open). Place is convenient to get to and out of, off of Fairview.There is a McDonald's, Gigi's Cupcakes, Pancake House, SouthPark Mall, and HomeGoods to stop by.
3	Gas is super cheap here at 2.97 a gallon not to mention easy to get in and out of. As far as gas stations go it's par for the course! I like this one over the circle k across the street much better especially as far as safety goes at night.
