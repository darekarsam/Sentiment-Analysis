1	Worst haircut ever!  Obviously butchered my hair... And they acted like nothing was the matter.  It was SO bad even my husband and 20 people on Facebook commented.   Politely requested a refund - they shut me down and said they "don't do refunds".  I should have know better than to use a budget salon.  I had to have someone fix it which cost me even more money.  Don't waste your money!
5	Great Salon the staff was great along with the price! Recommend it everyone..
1	Worst place EVER! The only stylist worth seeing is Bri, good luck getting in though. She has been cutting my hair for two years now. I have always been very patient to see her I mean what's a little wait for a great cut right? Wrong today I called and scheduled an apt when I showed up they said it would be more than a half hour wait & where very rude, I recommend the one on 75th & thunderbird they actually care about ppl and do a top notch job! Ask for Dylan he is much better than these clowns!
