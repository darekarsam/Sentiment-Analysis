2	I am a general contractor and have had dealings with many tile/flooring companies in San Diego and the metro Phx area.  I went to Imperial after hearing an ad on the radio.  I wanted tile for a bathroom I am remodeling in my own home.  After 2 visits I landed on a 12x24 silver vein cut travertine.  I was told it was in CA (no surprise all tile comes from the Long Beach ports).  I was told more than once thatthey get 2-3 trucks a week from CA and that I would have my tile in 2 maybe 3 days.  Well, I am on day 13 now.  Multiple calls from me, none from them.  I have heard some lame excuses so far and was told Weds it would be finally be here Fri, then Fri that they needed to log it in Sat and now Sat that it was not on the truck.  Well, just refund my 100% payment already and I will go somewhere else.  Thanks for a wasted 2 weeks.
5	Great place for tile and travertine. Good selection of accent tiles.
5	Yeah E Yeah, Imperial Wholesale hooked me up with some wood flooring.  They have another location on 43rd Ave and Indian school and I wasn't too impressed with that one but I'm so glad I made the trek out to this location because I found the exact wood I was looking for and it was on sale!
2	Good selection of stuff. However, their customer service sucks. I've been here twice and both times I had to wait an unbelievable amount of time to check out. They really need to work on this. I don't think I'll be recommending this place because of it.
5	If you are looking for great customer service and a pretty funny guy at the same time this is your place. David went out of his way to help me even thought this shop was not going to get the sale of my business. The home I am building is 200 miles away. Nevertheless Dave M. still offered to help me. Great customer service is rare these days. Keep up the great work Imperial!
