1	In the tradition of full disclosure, I never really liked Quiznos that much anyway....I'm more of a Firehouse or Harris Teeter Hoagie guy, but the other day I was hungry on lunch and decided to give them a try.  The Roast Beef and cheddar looked pretty good.  But it wasn't.  It had a weird sort of taste, and with every other bite or so I would notice these odd little mushroom bits...you know like the canned mushrooms, and the seasoning and added flavors were not to my liking.  Not to mention the after effects....uggggh...never again Quiznos....never again.
4	Two words....Chicken Milano!  I'm not a big fan of Quiznos they're just too expensive for a toasted sub, but I have no problems opening the wallet for this toasty treat!   A great sub with chicken, sun dried tomato and basil pesto, plus the trimmings are definitely something to smile about......give it a try, I'm sure you'll agree:-)
2	Meh is right on for this Quizno's.  Mmmm... Toasty just doesn't cut it when the quality of meats and veg served on the bread is below par on most visits.  Prime rib sub that was a mass of gristle and fat.  A Lobster and Seafood sub that tasted like a Salt and Seafood sub.  Cucumbers that had seen much better days before they wound up on my sandwich.The saving grace.  When they have Clam Chowder as a soup choice, it's actually pretty good!
