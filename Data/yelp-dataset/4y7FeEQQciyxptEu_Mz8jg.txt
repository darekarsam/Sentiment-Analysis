4	*** EDIT: Not sure why, but I made the update to the location and they moved my review to the old location and deleted it here. They even took my new picture and attached it to the old location. ***I believe this is a new location first of all. It is in the same general location as the old one though?In any case the front desk girls were helpful and quick to get us signed up despite being a walk-in. I am not sure how much faster it would be with an appointment but im guessing that they fit you in as they can around the appointments.  All the appointments online were full.
1	The staff here was rude and in no hurry at all.  I waited 90 minutes for a simple blood test and finally gave up and left without getting it done by them.  In addition they are not sending blood work results to dr offices in a timely manner anymore.  My dr has had to chase down results many times now.  Looks like its time to find a new lab.
3	Staff is always friendly but it always takes forever. The process could definitely be streamlined a little more. Over a 30min wait to do something that takes less then 5min? Makes no sense. They are never in hurry to get people thru.....I dread coming here
2	Expect a long wait. The front desk personnel are rude and ask stupid questions. I had an order the nurse wrote stat on and the woman asked if I wrote that. Really?! do people do this because they are so pokey? Also when I arrived I needed to use the facilities. I was asked if I had orders before they would let me use the toilet. So people come in all the time to use their toilet. As if you can even find where they are. Rude!
