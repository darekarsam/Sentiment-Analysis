It's a great big new curry house in Newington whose full title is actually 'Imans grill - A taste of Punjab'.Inside it's fairly tastefully decked out. The tables and chairs are a nice, understated dark wood, there's nothing crazy going out. It's the outside that gets me. The sign is an enormous what looks like leopard print, and it's got big banners everywhere. Just has the look and feel of a tacky place.Onto the food, then. The selection here is enormous. They've all different types of curries to cater to all tastes. They even have a British section. Why the hell would you go to a curry house for an omelette? Who does that?! Anyway, the curry I had (Lamb Saag) was OK. Not terrible, but not mind blowing. Just OK. I reckon this place would be great to take a huge group to, it's bigger than the batcave.

Definitely a step up from other Indian restaurants, and the decor and atmosphere is inviting in addition to friendly staff. I've had Chicken Tikka Biryani, a specialty Punjabi dish (can't remember the name) as well as tasted others' meals and everything has been great. Also, it's BYOB which cuts down on the price of the bill and is a fun time to get together with friends. I'd recommend this place to anyone! Although I've been told it's not authentic, I've never been to India so I don't know what is. But it tastes good to me!
