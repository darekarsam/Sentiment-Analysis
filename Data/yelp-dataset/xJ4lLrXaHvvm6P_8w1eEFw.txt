5	This is a fantastic service which runs ferry trips under the two forth bridges and out to Inchcolm Island, where you have the option of disembarking to explore for an hour and a half or so whilst the boat returns to queensferry to collect more passengers.  The boat has seating inside and out, tables, toilets, and a bar which serves a variety of drinks, snacks and refreshments. Staying on the boat and just going to the island and back is a fun trip in itself which takes about an hour, with plenty if wildlife to be seen including seals and sometimes dolphins. However I definitely recommend taking the time and a little extra money to explore the island as there is so much to see, from the disused railway tunnels, abandoned bunkers from the war and the gorgeous old abbey which reminded me of Hogwarts! Watch out for the seagulls though who apparently get a bit feisty during nesting season... Overall great day out for the family, definitely worth taking a sail on the maid of the forth! Additionally they also run weekly jazz and folk cruises, which I'm keen to try. 5\5 stars!
