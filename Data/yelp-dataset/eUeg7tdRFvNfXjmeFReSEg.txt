3	7:00 PM and You CAN get a donut here!  A couple blocks away @ Peace, Love & Donuts, that is not the case.........Looked like they had all the donuts in stock.  grabbed some glazed and some chocolate glazed & trying a pittsburgh cream for the first time....not sure what the hype is all about regarding dunkin donuts coffee.  the coffee here sucks ass.
4	Must respect the Donuts!!!
5	Yeah, this DD is solid.  Fast service, plenty of fresh doughnut and munchkin options, perfect location on Forbes to walk to from PITT.  I'm sure i'll his this up on the reg.  Skip Starbucks across the street and get a chocolate frosted and a coffee here for the same calories, right?  haha
1	I ordered a Latte and for the first time I felt I drank the worst ever coffee in my one and half years in the US. The Caribous and Starbucks were closed and this was my only option. I threw the coffee into the trash even before it's half done. It sucks big time.
4	I can't tell you the excitement I had within me when I heard that a Dunkin was opening right on Forbes (and the intense apprehension knowing how many doughnuts I would be consuming in the future). As it turns out, however, I actually prefer their coffee more than anyone else's in Oakland. For me, this place is perfect to stop in when I need to grab a snack for a small group of people (i.e., for a committee meeting or a lab meeting). I simply walk in, order a dozen of whatever I want, grab a coffee and head out. The service and turnover time among patrons is very fast, the place operates as a well-oiled machine. And the diversity and quality of doughnuts is very good (though not the best). I'm very glad for this addition on Forbes.
5	A quick and convenient coffee shop. I've always been a Dunkin girl so I'm glad there's a location right on campus for me to get my fix. Way more affordable than the Starbucks they sell at the Pitt coffee carts, and it's actually decent coffee. I love the option of almond milk.
