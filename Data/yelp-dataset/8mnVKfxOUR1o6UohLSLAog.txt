5	My husband & I purchased a bunk bed & mattress at Max Discounts Furniture at 300 S. MLK. I'd like to recommend that store to all parents with small children. They have the largest selection of Bunk Beds I have ever seen. A Sales Lady Named Aymee helped me out. She promised me a delivery the following day and the truck showed up first thing in the morning, they assembled the two bunk beds on the 2nd floor and where in-n-out in 60 minutes.Thank You, Max Discounts.
1	My husband and I purchased new furniture from this company.  We were told delivery would be three to four weeks out. We are now many weeks past that and no sign of the furniture.  We have called and called and called and have been given the the run around by the store and the warehouse.  It would appear that we are going to be out several thousand dollars and there is no recourse that we can take.  We have researched them a lot since we paid for our non-existent furniture and it would appear that they have quite the history. They "go out of business", change their name and/or move (Oh look! It says they've moved on YELP. Surprise!!!)  when enough people get angry.  Learn from our mistake and lack of research BEFORE we shopped there.  If you are considering shopping there,  DO NOT GO! Do not.  I cannot stress this enough.  Turn around and walk away.  They are horrible and completely dishonest.  Just another wonderful thing to enjoy about living in Vegas.
