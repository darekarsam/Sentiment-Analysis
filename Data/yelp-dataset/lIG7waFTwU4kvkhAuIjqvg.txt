5	Can't rave about Joe enough!  Fine, I could, but it would take too much dang time.
5	Rolf & his Team are amazing!  They jump right in and get right to work.  They are proactive thinkers and when a issue arrives no mater what they are doing they get right to work on it.  Closings happen right on time with no issues because they have already gone over all paperwork with the borrower. I would HIGHLY suggest Conner Monson Team!
5	I've worked with Rolf over the past 10 years.  He has helped me with numerous loans though out that time.  He helped me on my personal home as well as on several rental property purchases.  He also helped with the subsequent refinancing of many of those properties too.   The process has always been seamless and painless for me.  We always closed on time and never had any surprises.  They have built a great team over there and I am looking forward to the next loan.
5	I worked with Rolf and his team about a year and a half ago on a home refi and am pleased to say the experience convinced me that this business is truly a five-star operation. They do everything right, from first contact to follow-up, and not just immediately after closing follow-up but well beyond. Their professionalism is paramount and consistent, and the perfect complement to the friendly, personalized service they provide. It's clear they have a system, and it works. They supply a wealth of educational materials and opportunities to ask questions, and they're always available to answer additional questions and address any concerns (legitimate or neurotic) that come up. I got a fair rate and closed on time, and I always knew where we were in the process--even when Rolf was on vacation. Those are the basics they strive to deliver. Without a doubt, they deliver so much more.
