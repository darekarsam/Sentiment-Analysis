5	Great experience. I have taken 2 mid-price range watches (around $250)  in for battery change. Impressive pricing. The owner is honest, fair and very professional. I loved going in here to see all the vintage time pieces that he has, he even has certain jewelry piecse and collectibles that you can buy straight off the glass display. I highly recommend this shop. Even when I move I will always take my watches back here when I get the chance to be repaired. It's hard to find a reliable and quality shop with fair prices. Oh, watch battery is only supposed to last about 1.5 year, surprisingly it has been 2 years since the battery for my first watch was changed at this shop, and the watch is still going strong. This tells you that the owner uses high quality products and he charges very reasonable prices for his services. Not to mention it only takes 10-15 minute for him to get the dead battery changed out, can you ask for anything more?
5	Fantastic experience. I brought my luminox watch in for a battery replacement thinking it needed the full new gasket and battery to remain waterproof. This would have cost $45. However the owner went out of his way to say the gasket on these is very strong and likely didn't need replacing. He did just the battery (and it only took about 4 minutes!) at a cost of $9. Awesome. This gentlemen is one of those rare shop owners that you can tell is a master of his trade. I will be back with my nicer timepieces when they need servicing.
5	Took my watch in for a new battery and he had it back up and working in less than 5 minutes for only $8. I would highly recommend this store. He had a ton of clock repairs he was working on as well so any clocks that need fixing- this is the place to go!
