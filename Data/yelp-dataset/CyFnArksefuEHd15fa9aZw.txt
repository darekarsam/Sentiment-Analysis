5	I found Mary Kay through a review of her services on Rod Sicker's yelp page (she worked there years ago before she started her own business).Her facials are great, and she uses wonderful products (Eminence).  She is very conscious of your concerns/skin care goals and tailors her services to your particular needs.  She also does a full complement of waxing services.  Her eyebrow shaping services are the most exacting and consistent I have ever had.I was previously employees in the spa industry, and have worked in two of the top-rated destination spas in the country.  Mary Kay's service matches or exceeds the experiences I have had at those spas, without the fancy-spa price.  She is very professional, and returns phone calls promptly.  She also accepts online reservations.  Highly recommended.  So glad to have her in C-U.
5	After 4 years on the University of Illinois campus, I have never found a place that does an exceptional job of eyebrow waxing- until today. Mary Kay listened to my requests and concerns about my eyebrows, and proceeded to give me an eyebrow wax based off of the structure of my face. I am more than happy with the results and I will continue to come back to Mary Kay's for further treatments. Her prices are very reasonable for the services she offers. Seriously, check this place out!
5	Mary Kay is awesome. She is knowledgable and gives a restorative facial combined with lymphatic drainage. Her products are pure luxury with organic plant derived essence that smell and feel great. Her studio is in the Senator's Inn Bed & Breakfast so it gives you the feeling that you are on a trip out of town.  A treatment with Mary Kay is a zen experience.
