5	Built web site, mobile app and some social media.  Very helpful and professional.  Getting good traffic with the SEO package and some new business conversions for us already.  Feels good to be making money again. Thanks
1	3 Years now and they have not refunded my company or came close to working on our website. They are the worst and most unethical company that I have ever know to exist. If you are ever looking for a bad experience in the Charlotte market for someone that can work on your website please call them, they might return your call.
1	I am embarrassed to say how much I paid this company for nothing - thousands and thousands of dollars. Reports were terribly late, my reps cared nothing about me or my company and the customer service was abysmal. Additionally, they charged my company for 2 months of service after I cancelled, then acted like I was crazy when I very kindly & calmly asked them to remove the charges worth over $5000 - they acted like I was crazy. I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone or any business. Shady and concerned only about THEIR bottom line, not the growth of YOUR business.
1	I cannot write enough bad things about Clickcom. Larry, Curley and Moe would best describe their business operations. These guys have no clue how to respond to customers, plus they bill you for services which they are not even providing. Our company pad them several thousand dollars over the course of several months for managing our Adwords. Come to find out after all that time they had not even submitted any ads at all. I guess they were just pocketing all of the advertising funds which we entrusted them with. If you call them to complain you are lucky if anyone even picks up the phone. Do not waste your time or energy working with these clowns.
