2	Yes, I visited two Wendy's restaurants yesterday. But I only ate at one -- this one.My food was okay (grilled chicken sandwich, fries, drink) but I had to request hot fries after I tasted mine.Surfaces (order counter and table where I sat) showed marks from having been wiped but not dried; thankfully there was no odor.I had to wipe my seat out before I sat down as there was a small bit of something sticky.I would have just changed seats except I needed to sit where there was a bench and it was the only one available near the front and facing forward. (I wanted to make sure my fries arrived safely...)
1	Went to this Wendy's this evening becuase my pregnant wife and 2 year old wanted a milkshake.Ordered through the drive through. When they handed us the milkshake, there was whip cream on top. My wife asked could they remove it. The manager smirked at her. Stared us down with disgust the whole time. He spooned some off, then mixed in the rest. As he handed it to me, he stared me down with a grimacing look without a word. I asked was there a problem, he just kept staring and refused to respond. We will never go back to this restaurant. If the manager(Jeff?) bald headed guy, fat, country high pitch tone, doesn't like managing a restaurant, he should be demoted to cleaning it. There are too many other good employees out there that would value that position if given the chance.I encourage everyone to watch out for this guy, and report anything out of order!!!!
1	Horrible customer service. I went through the drive ordered 2 burgers wanted extra onions. They put one small piece on each burger. I went inside was informed onions did not com on that burger so that was considered extra onion. Not to mention the pile of mayonnaise on burger.  The manager was very rude, on the plus side the regional manager did call me and apologized.
