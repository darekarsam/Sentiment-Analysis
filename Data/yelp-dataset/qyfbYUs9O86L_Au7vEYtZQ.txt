4	Came here a few times with my boyfriend when he still lived in the area. Honestly, best Italian restaurant...all the pasta is great. This place specializes in pasta, so don't expect any pizzas or anything. You can't go wrong with any.They have I think over 30 different kinds of pasta including seafood, vegetarian, traditional etc. Presentation is really well done too! Ambiance is great, low lighting (romantic!) small (so reserve!) and service is excellent.. Our waiter drew on my mat what the types of pasta were because I didn't know the difference since the names were unfamiliar to me. (ex. rotini/linguini etc) I was a total pasta noob back then.  Anyway he was very sharp and witty, definitely knew his stuff. It's so inexpensive here I mean you can walk away with a full stomach for less than $20. Some pasta are more expensive but its not by much. This little Italian spot is worth checking out. It's right next to Verdun metro about 1 minute away. So it's very convenient. Go here if you are a pasta lover! Oh and btw it's a mom and pops kind of place.
5	Ive been to this place quite a few times. Food has always been excellent.....service too. It can be a bit slow depending how busy it is. But than again this is a place to go for a long intimate dinner, not somewhere to go when youre in a rush, bring your own wine to drink while you wait, and if you finish the bottle you can run across the street to the depanneur for another one lol. Great pasta and salad. Should be noted that pasta is the only thing they serve as a main course. Not the place to go if youre doing the low carb or no crab thing. Highlight is the ambiance and decor, very cozy, quaint and romantic
