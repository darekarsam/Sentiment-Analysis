4	Nice decor, can get a bit cramped at times when it's very busy, excellent drinks (especially the Smoothies and Espresso Cooler), delicious baked goods (love the Cinnamon Crumb Cake and Cranberry Scone) and very friendly staff. Consistently good service.
3	Removed one star because they keep charging for whipped cream. Also the tiny amount you receive is not worth the extra $0.70! For less than $3 I can go to the supermarket and buy a gigantic can of extra creamy whipped cream. This is bad corporate policy.
4	Ive been going there to study for the pat two weeks after work, and so far Ive hadn't had any complaints of this establishment. I always get the cappuccino w/ soy and its made perfect every single time. The staff there are very knowledgeable of what they have to offer. The size is a bit on the smaller end but the atmosphere is always pleasant. 4 stars just because of the size here other than that they are good to go in my book!!
