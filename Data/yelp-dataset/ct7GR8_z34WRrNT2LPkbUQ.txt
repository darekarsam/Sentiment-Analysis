4	As far as a Quizno's goes this one is clean and the owner is very friendly.  I'm in here a lot since it's close to work and enjoy the food.  Gets busy around noon but the line moves pretty fast
4	I generally enjoy a sub from Quiznos, but they have to be made properly otherwise they aren't that great. Luckily when I have visited this location they have been pretty good about making the sandwich the right way and the taste results have been excellent.I have had trouble with some Quiznos locations taking coupons in the past, but I haven't had any issues at this location yet, so I am happy about that. I also love their cinnamon sugar cookie, which I have to order every time!One issue I have had here is that the soda machines have had nasty pop. Workers really need to stay on top of that, but otherwise I have been pleased with my visits here.
5	Showed up at 2:00 to avoid the lunch crowd and still waited 20-30 minutes for our sandwiches. After one bite, I knew why. Great sandwich! Get the Dutch crunch bread-yum! Note this is a walk in take out eatery. We enjoyed our sandwiches at Golden Gate Park. The sandwiches are a little expensive, but I think they are worth every penny!
1	Ordered food online. They failed to deliver 1 of the 5 combos we ordered. They use grubhub for orders and told us we had to take it up with grubhub and offered no resolution. It also took them 30 minutes longer to deliver than promised. Terrible service.
