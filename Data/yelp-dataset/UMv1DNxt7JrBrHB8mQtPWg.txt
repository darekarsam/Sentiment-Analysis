1	I originally took my lawn mower there for what I thought would be a warranty repair. I was pleased with the repair even though it wasnt under warranty and I had to pay to the tune of $90 out the door. A little over a month later, my mower malfunctioned. I called the store thinking someone could help me and I got Mrs. Ayers. She claims that she is the owner of the store and her customer service skills are non-existent. This interaction was mild but I could immediately tell that she was volatile. She told me that due to the fact of the mower sitting for a month since its last use, condensation had built up in the gas tank and water had diluted the gas causing the malfunction. I was prompted to always keep the tank full. I wasnt informed of this when I picked up the mower from the initial repair. I called around as this seemed like sketchy advice. Four other reputable shops informed me that this couldnt be the case due to thermodynamics. The average low temp in Las Vegas over the last four weeks was in the high 50's and the dewpoint was in the mid 30's. In order to get condensation, the gas or ambient air would have to be in the mid 30's to achieve dew. I called and let her know that without knowledge of what was the issue and that they wouldnt get the repair due to warranty of work, four other shops disproved her advice. My third call found to be less friendly as I couldnt get a word in as Mrs. Ayers insisted on screaming the whole conversation. This resulted in me talking louder due to not being able to get a word in. I let her know that if keeping the gas tank full were an important piece of information, why didnt they tell me to do such a thing when I originally picked up the first repair?She told me that I needed to read the manual. I was informed to use the proper gas, stabilizer, why the mower had malfunctioned but they did not tell me how to keep the mower from malfunctioning again? When asked why again, she blew up and told me its not her job to make sure I know how the mower works. If this shop is full of professionals, why would they let me leave knowing that I had relied on their advice and that they had left out what would keep the mower running. At the end of being put on hold twice and screamed at for ten minutes about how she gave me options but that if I brought the mower in again and they performed the repairs, I would be charged due to warranty being only 30 days despite one use since repair, I was hung up on. SAVE YOUR MONEY!! DONT GO HERE!! THESE PEOPLE ARE CROOKS AND MRS. AYERS JUST WANTS SOMEONE TO SCREAM AT!!I cant believe that they would handle their customer's issues like this. I will never be back and I will do my best to let everyone know that they are the worst company in town.
1	Still a one star review and if I could, this review would have no stars. After not using the lawnmower for a while and it still not working, I called a mechanic buddy of mine over. We pulled the carburetor apart, a very easy process, and found that the gas had crystallized. Regardless of the stabilizer, the gas would still crystallize. The fuel valve was clogged with crystallized gas. The whole procedure took 15 minutes and I even came up with a solution to get this to stop. *******Burlap and Landscape, if you can read the next section, this is what you should suggest or just do and charge for it for your clients**********I added a shutoff valve similar to a petcock on the fuel line. I fire the lawnmower up and start the yard work. On the last couple of strips, I turn the valve off so the float and bowl arent supplied with anymore fuel and I finish the lawn. When the fuel is used up in a few minutes, the mower will shut off and this will solve the issue. If there isnt any fuel in the bowl to sit, nothing will crystallize. ********************************************************************************So to Mrs. Ayers, you and your husband are hacks. I did in 15 minutes what you charged me 2 hours to do and lied on top of it. You claimed there was water in my fuel. Please reference my previous review about dew points. The gas had expired regardless of putting stabilizer in it. With some help, I disassembled the carburetor and cleared the lines myself, added new fuel, added a shutoff valve and the mower worked fabulously.
1	DO NOT GO HERE!!!! The owner is a crook. She sold my senior citizen father a broken part. When he tried to return it and get his money back, she accused him of breaking it himself while verbally abusing him and kicked him out of her store. I, his daughter, went to try to explain to this crook that my father had purchased a broken part and needed a refund. She started yelling, cursing, screaming, and verbally abusing me when I questioned her customer service. She then kicked me out of her store too. I cannot believe that there is a business like this. I'm only giving this place a one star by default, but they deserve no stars. They deserve to be shut down. This lady is abusive and a crook! All this over $18.91.
1	Do not go here the owner Laura is very rude and has horrible customer service. I have been buying parts and also equipment here for over 2 years just within the last 6 months I have spent over $2000 in new equipment here and she has the nerve to tell me that's not a lot of money and if I don't like the way she runs things I can go somewhere else
