2	Let me first say, I haven't made up my mind if I like the Pier 1 concept.  It's not Crate & Barrel, nor Z Gallerie, nor Cost Plus World Markets, and not even West Elm.  Yet, it has a little of each of these stores at a slightly higher price -- and, that's the problem  I stop here every so often and all it does is give me ideas for something else at one of their above competitors: Wine glasses, rugs, furniture, you name it.  Sorry!
2	I haven't really ever found anything that is useful to me or my style.  I love Cost Plus, Stein Mart and Anthropologie more.  This stuff is just too high priced.  There isn't enough of a varied selection (everything is the same style).
4	Love this place for seasonal decor. Especially around all holidays. They have unique and cool decorations for inside and out. Also, they have the best selection of candles around. I'm a big fan!!!
