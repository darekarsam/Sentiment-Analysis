3	Very nice gyro. Fries were a bit generic. They have delicious tira misu! The pizza is OK, not bad, but not fantastic. I'd get the gyros there (very meaty and fresh) and tira misu.
4	We always call this place the Euromart. I use to work in the GBU building and would meet the boyfriend for lunch here. They make a mean gyro. I've never had their pizza. That's just weird to me but I guess they expanded so that they could stay in business.
5	We kept seeing the sign for the cheese pizza sale. 8.99, take out only, decided to stop. Definitely a great choice. The pizza was the right crunch to the crush, the cheese was perfectly cooked, couldn't have asked for a better pizza.
4	There are tons of pizza options in the south hills. This place is the closest to my house so my boyfriend and I randomly tried it a year or so ago and loved it! Now we get take out here regularly. EM is unique considering when you go inside you will notice they are a Russian mini mart as well as a pizza /gyro place (interesting right?!) so not only can you get delicious pizza there, but you can grab a unique snack that you wouldn't be able to find anywhere else! I have even just walked around and looked at their unique items while they were making my pizza! They are family owned and have awesome customer service- always friendly and helpful. The pizza is delicious- sauce is packed with flavorful and the cheese is wonderful. I like the crust but sometimes find it too doughy for my liking. Save your receipts! Save 10 and get your next pizza free :).
