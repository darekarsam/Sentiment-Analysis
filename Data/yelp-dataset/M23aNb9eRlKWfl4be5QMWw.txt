3	I had a mixed experience here.  They misspelled (their mistake was first) the title of the book and I didn't catch it when they sent me the confirmation (my mistake in not catching their mistake). Unfortunately that means I have a misspelled title on the spine of the book. Besides the misspelled title the replacement binding is good.
5	I found Grimm Bindery online while looking for a place to bind a genealogical collection of transcribed letters and photographs I had put together for a client. I had the pages printed in Massachusetts and mailed them to the bindery in Wisconsin. Everyone I interacted with was extremely helpful and friendly. They stayed in touch with me throughout the process and shipped the final product to my client, who was absolutely overjoyed with the results. These books will be in their family for generations. Thank you to Grimm Bindery for the beautiful work!
5	The folks here are great.  Haven't received my finished product yet, but the costumer service experience was amazing.  The staff was extremely helpful in placing a custom order, and stayed late on a day when their closing time was the earliest I could get there.  AWESOME!!! I can't wait to get my book!
5	I was amazed by this organization.The hard cover books they printed/bound for me were beautiful.Every interaction I had with the organization, whether on technical issues, cost or schedule, exceeded my expectations.I can not recommend them enough.
