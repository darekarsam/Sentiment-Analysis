2	Decent food, nothing spectacular...byob and a very nice owner
4	A great place for a quick inexpensive lunch. I use to work in old Montreal where there is no shortage of incredible restaurants to chose from but sometimes you need to get your Pho fix!My Pho buddy Isabelle and I would make the ten or so minute walk to Pho Vietnam every few weeks. The service isn't 5 star or anything but for a quick lunch it's fine, in fact Isabelle and I got a quick from the lady who seems to own the place. She come off as a little grumpy when as we would order she said yea yea yea, like we were taking too long. I know it sounds annoying but really it just adds to the ambiance. The restaurant itself is small and a little crowded, your seated at long communal tables next to people you don't know but that adds to the charm. The place is clean, the food is tasty and the service fast yet quirky, all the makings of a good lunch spot!
3	I found the noodles to be a little bit too raw.The taste of the soup was fine though
1	Came here on a Canada day rushed us to leave because they were closing we did not even order yet, Just went to eat pho across from here
1	I waited 30 minutes for 6 spring rolls to take out and there was only 6 customers inside the restaurant. Service sucks !
