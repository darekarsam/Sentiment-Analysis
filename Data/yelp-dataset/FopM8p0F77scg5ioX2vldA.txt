5	We came here for dinner tonight. This store is different from the rest as it is a flagship store and they are making changes to their menu and the storefronts. This store is much larger than the usual ones and has plenty of room for dining inside. If you order your food to eat there they give you a number and bring the food to you. They also serve your food on real dishes with actual silverware. The service was great and so was the staff. This store also offered soups and freshly made salads in addition to the usual yummy sandwiches. I ordered from the new Capture 2 menu which is one half a sandwich and either a salad or bowl of soup. I got the Bobbie and BBQ Chicken Salad. I've had the Bobbie many times before and it was delicious as usual. I had never had the salad before but it was absolutely delicious and I will definitely order it again. Just enough food to fill me up. We also tried a sample of the chicken soup which was yummy too. I can't wait to come back here and also for the other Capriotti's to follow suit like this one.
5	Always delicious, but this location is so well designed. The staff is very friendly and helpful. It's a step up from the other locations around town.
3	I don't know if it's only me, but I felt like cleanness wasn't there specially on a brand new place, bathrooms  really stinky and dirty all the floors  full on crumbs and tables not clean enough, service and food  are ok.
