3	I used to do Taekwondo as a child with this business and I decided to step inside and check it out again.  I don't think that I would reapply at my age, because it just struck me as juvenile.  The funny thing about this place is that there used to be a teacher (and I believe that he was one of the founders of the organization) here named Mr. Baxter and I recently spotted him in a spoof on Taekwondo called The Fist Foot Way filmed in Concord.  Wow, that was pretty shocking, overall it made me pretty jaded about Taekwondo and I really can't take it seriously anymore.  I would recommend this place for kids though, because it teaches good values of discipline and respect.
1	If you are looking for an "after-school" program for your kids where they jump around for 45 minutes, but learn nothing related to "real" Korean Taekwondo or for that matter Martial Arts, then this is the place to be. The fact that the word Karate is over the door of a Taekwondo facility is due to the fact that they are not sanctioned by the  KoreanTaekwondo association as their forms, techniques and testing are not approved nor recognized. Students are passed from one belt to the next regardless of how they perform during testing. Simple logic is, pass the kids, make them happy so they keep coming in and paying the monthly fee. The basic phylisophy of martial arts is nothing more then a pledge they say at the start of each class, but zero is done to ensure these words are understood or followed. Most of the kids are out of control and disrespectful to the instructors and other students. Any attempt to voice the slightest bit of constructive critism is met with anger followed by bullying emails. If you want real martial arts, go somewhere else, this place is a joke.
5	This has been a great experience for my kids. Sean and his staff are amazing. Can't say enough about his teaching and ability to relate to younger kids.
