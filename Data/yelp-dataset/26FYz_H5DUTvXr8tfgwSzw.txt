5	Always yummy!! a little pricey but its worth it and is reflected in the quality of the food and ambiance. Staff is nice, good setting for a date, studying, hanging out or just a pick up fpr lunch!
3	I only had a coffee here. Didn't have time to eat. So I can't really review the food (although it did look fantastic). The staff weren't too friendly and seemed a bit abrupt but hey, give me my coffee and no one gets hurt...
4	Great little spot where servers are friendly and speak both FR and EN.  There is a nice mix of business people and student who hang out here.It's close to shopping, theatre and other restos if you're waiting for a reservation or a flick.The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is that it is over priced.  Your coffee can't cost more than Starbucks...
4	Nice little coffee shop on 2 floors for seating. I was served in English without any problem. Nice decorations up for the Christmas holidays.Large green tea is pricier than at Second Cup but it is still not bad a 3$ and some change. The wi-fi is decent and there are a few electrical outlets to plug in your laptop. Seems they don't really monitor how much you time you spend surfing when it's not too busy. Open until midnight, the latest in Laval I know of (others close at 10 pm or 11 pm).
