5	Kathy is a wonderful therapist and a joy to work with. She is always open and provides useful advice. Her "Five C's To A Successful Marriage" are: Commitment, Communication, Conflict, Cherish, and Communion of Spirit. In her book, Creating Love For A Lifetime - The Five C's To A Successful Marriage, Kathy describes these principles in detail, and illustrates how the many couples who have used these principles revitalize their love. I also love to follow her blog on her website, http://www.kathyinfeld.com, FREE great advice.
1	Don't see Kathy for any issues you have. My ex and I saw Kathy several times in between which my ex made private visits to Kathy during which Kathy ended up taking her side with without hearing all angles of the problem.Kathy ended up encouraging my ex to leave the relationship, which she did.It turns out that my ex has a personality disorder and required treatment. Probably best that we did split up but I found Kathy's methods less than professional.
5	Kathy is amazingly insightful and has been a blessing for me and for my family.She makes herself available all the time, not just during appointments. Her care and thought is also evident in and out of office visits. She takes a true personal interest in all that does. Love her!!!!
