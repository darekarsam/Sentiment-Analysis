1	This use to be a great place until someone took over the business a few months ago! I was nice and tried out the new staff (big mistake) it took 3 different people to get my pedicure, French tip and flower done, and even then it wasn't done nicely.  I ended up being there 2 hours just to leave so frustrated and disappointed..my cousin went after I did and the same exact thing happened to her..it's too bad because alot of my family were regulars there for many years and now we are definitly going to find a new place..We miss you Vivian!!
4	Great pedicure!  Sonny was incredible. Professional and what a great massage. Found this gem after a lot of looking. You won't be disappointed.
5	I have been coming here for quite a while now. They do a great job ans the prices are very reasonable.  They are very friendly and always welcome walk-ins. They do get quite busy on the weekends. Their Spa Pedicure is AWESOME!!!
5	Went to Las Vegas for a family reunion and spontaneously wanted to get my nails done. I went here since it was near me at that moment. First time getting a gel mani and they did amazing! My nails are going on for 3 weeks and no chipping whatsoever besides nail growth. Staff is very friendly and the price is very reasonable. If I lived in Vegas this salon would be my go to place.
5	I LOVE THIS PLACE. !!!new owners his name is long and him and his wife are really amazing.. He does the best Job ever and never rushes me .. I recommend this place .. Great service and his work is the best in Vegas
