4	The price is right & friendly desk lady. Fun place to shop in and located in Pittsburgh's Little Italy is a plus.  I got lots of great new pieces.  I might rate it higher, but the parking is a total pain.
4	A high-end thrift store. A little more expensive than what you'd see at a Goodwill, but all of the clothing is good quality, in nice condition and pretty popular brand name products. I was looking at a few nice sweaters that were $8-15 each. Still a huge steal compared to what you'd be paying in a department store! The woman at the front desk was very friendly and so was everyone shopping there. It seems like they have a lot of turnover and a lot of regular customers. There is a small section of shoes and housewares and also a fitting room in the back. They had a few designer racks that were out of my price range, but seemed reasonably priced if you're into that.I'll pop in occasionally to see what turns up.
