5	I remember this place.  Years ago, we used to eat here like once a month, when my family lived in Germany.  We would always order whatever was on the menu that was closest to America home food, lol.   It was a nice way for our family to get out and do something different so Mom didn't have to cook.  It had a nice atmosphere inside, and the service was really friendly.  The food was great, which was why we always went back, lol.  I kind of miss this place...   I wish I had pictures of it.
