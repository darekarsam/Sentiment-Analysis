4	Great new SAQ. The 4th within walking distance to my house. Hey... if you're going to have a drinking problem, have it in the Plateau;)
4	Tis the season of the SAQ! Since these are pretty cookie cutter Quebec run booze monopoly shops there's not going to be too too much to say, but I've found the staff friendly and helpful here, and it's nice to see this old building back in use as lower St Laurent lives through it's perpetual changes. It's not tiny, it doesn't stay open particularly late. It is what it is, and there's booze there.
