4	I first went here because my roommate and I felt the need to get more work done. She had been here before, and I had not. I am wary of tattoo shops that I've never been to, but my roommate had previously had work done there, so I trusted her judgement.  I was unsure when I walked up to the shop, it is very small and it seemed older from the outside. When I walked in, I was pleasantly surprised. The shop was very clean and all tools were sterilized in front of me. My artist was nice enough, and did a very good job with the cross on my back. She did the ink to my specifications and made sure I was involved in the process every step of the way. For how large my tattoo is, it was very decently priced. All in all it was a pretty decent experience.
1	Went there yesterday to get my nose pierced and the lady that did it, Kile, was VERY rude. She was also piercing my best friends tongue and was rude with her too. Every question we asked she would answer with the least words she could and gave us dirty looks and the wrong tips and advice the whole time. I have had my tongue pierced for 3 years and she told my best friend that everything me and everyone else we know, did as their tongue was healing was wrong... She literally said "who is telling you this stuff?!" She is a very rude piercer. Never, NEVER going here again!!!!
5	Mike is my artist! He is absolutely amazing and is willing to do whatever it takes to make his clients happy! He's currently doing a Star Wars sleeve on me and every piece he adds gets more and more amazing! I highly recommend him!
