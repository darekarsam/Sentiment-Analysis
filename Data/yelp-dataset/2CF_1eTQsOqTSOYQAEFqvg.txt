4	Was hesitant after I learned that organizing had switched hands this year, but the essence of the festival is still there. Classic favourites like crepes, cookie stalls, meat and pretzel stall, and the ornament stall was still there. There did seem to be a lot more stalls this year; but many of the stalls were repeats (I counted 4 of the same coffee stalls, and way too many mulled wine stalls all from the same company). There were way less rides, and the skating rink was in an awkward position and smaller, so that it made it very congested to try and get to the stalls. Saddest moment was when I realized the candy nut place was missing. I will admit that it was much more difficult to find bespoke stalls, instead of corporate stalls, which is the whole reason why I go to the Christmas market... Sound like a bit of a Debbie Downer, but my favourite stalls were still there, so I'm giving a good rating.
