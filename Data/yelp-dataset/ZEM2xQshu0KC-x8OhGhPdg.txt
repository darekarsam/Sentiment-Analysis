5	Directly across from my office, tons of variety in stock and super-nice staff earn Rite Aid a happy 5 Stars. As usual, I forgot multiple travel niceties but also needed a spot to replenish my daily water supply. Rite Aid to the rescue!Much cheaper than my hotel (duh!) and I even found a new loofa... Ya gotta pick up those things when you see themGood times!
3	Nice, friendly staff.  WIsh they had what I had come in for.  Carmex anyone?  I thought it was a regular staple at any drugstore....
2	It's a convenience store, like Walgreens or CVS.I came in to get an Arnold Palmer iced tea. The only person manning the counter was not to enthusiastic about working there, and constantly was checking the door. When someone came in, they gave a bland generic greeting. It felt awkward to be there.
3	Hello FriendsI come here often to pick up a few lil snacks during work hours. It is what it is, nothing that stands out about this location.........Except the fact that they advertise Western Union but the thing Never works. What draws me to this place (other than it being less than 50yards from the gig) is the drink specials. No No No.. they don't sale alcohol. But Arizona Tea's usually BoGo free, Gatoraid, etc... Heck on my visit today, they were on sale for .67 cents. A penny saved, is a penny earned!!
3	Buy one get one Arizona iced tea!
