1	Not sure I will go back.... I bought a 10 piece bedset about 11am this morning for $60, when I took it out of bag at 4pm to wash the sheets I pulled the comforter out and it had holes all in it. So I went back and they tried to blame me saying I washed it in washing machine when I did not.. So I grab another of the exact same one I bought earlier and I said can we please check this to make sure there's no holes then sure enough this one had holes. Well the manager proceeded to tell me that this was bound to happen with the microfiber material. So I said fine I'll get something else. So I picked out a different one looked at comforter (I didn't remove it all the way) and it was fine no tares or holes so I said cool. Well I just got home and opened the bag and it's missing 3 things!!! The sheets and two decorative pillows that the bag says should be in there. I mean seriously how lazy are these employees !!???

5	My daughter was looking for a full size quilt. She found one that she really liked but it was a California king size comforter. I asked the cashier Suze if she had one in full size. She informed me that she did not have one in this store, but that she could looked if there was one available in another store. She was able to find one but, in a Phoenix store. While we were talking about what freeway to take and major crossroads, an Anna's employee offered to picked up the comforter and bring it to this store.The customer service in this store exceed my expectations! Thank you so much fro the great customer service :)
