4	It's time to top off the tank before heading back to LA.The price on the sign showed $3.69 but when I get to the pump it's $3.64.  SWEET!One thing about Phoenix, you can drive 3-4 miles and gas prices from station to station may vary only a few cents, up to 3 or MAYBE 5 cents per gallon regardless of brand,  it's very consistant, unlike LA.    In LA I've driven a mile or two and see prices vary as much as 15 - 20 cents a gallon from one station to another!QT has a nice decent sized store with plenty of munchies, including REAL food like sandwichws, salads, etc, plus beverages and other snacks.   It's always been clean inside and the staff has always been nice.
4	I live near this QT.  The staff is always super nice and the store is always clean.
4	The best convenience store around. I'll drive past 3 circle k stores just to go to a qt. They have everything you would want in a gas station. Giving 4 stars because their gas prices are usually higher than everywhere else.
5	In the industrial part of town so a little old of a neighborhood but not to bad. The intersection trying to get into this QT is the worse in AZ . The light going west off the freeway is a no left , so you have to go about a mile and do a u-turn due to the LONG traffic line trying to get onto the freeway !
4	Stopped in to grab lunch on Christmas Eve. Got a hot dog with ketchup, mustard, and relish, and ordered a plain buttered pretzel with cheese from the kiosk at the Kitchen...I love that thing! The pretzel came with a free drink and I got a Cherry Limeade with crushed ice. QuikTrip is great. Where else can 2 people eat lunch for 6 bucks? And it was tasty. The only area I see for improvement would be the hot dog buns. They are nothing special. A pretzel bun would be awesome! :)
