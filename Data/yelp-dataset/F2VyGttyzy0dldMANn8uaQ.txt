1	So my wife and I went in to purchase window treatments for our house.  We must have not had the air of South Park on us as we had salespeople walk by us with no one even asking if we needed anything; even as we started to look through sample books and a clearly not doing anything sales lady walked by multiple times.  My business will be taken elsewhere.
