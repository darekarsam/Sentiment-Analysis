3	I got the beef doner plate.  It was ok, but not particularly flavourful.  Also, I didn't really feel filled up after I left.  But, like, ok, at the end of the day.
4	Love me some Rana. The chicken doner wrap is the best IMO
4	Quick and cheap middle eastern food, and surprisingly good for the price. The chicken donair is great, and the baklava is good enough. Grab the donair plate if you're looking for more value, though the pita is good for lunch.
3	Colleague: "What do you want for lunch?"Me: "Meat."Colleague:"...Rana?"Me: "Yup."That is how most conversations are carried out just before deciding on going to Rana for lunch.  Usually I order the chicken doner, no onions, and it will taste exactly as I expect it to taste: meaty, filling, and delicious.
4	The best Turkish bite in town! Must try..
3	I used to go there a lot when it first opened up. I loved all of the wraps. I went a few times recently and it just doesn't taste the same anymore. When i would go the male owner would be there preparing my order and the past few times there is a lady that prepares my order... maybe she doesn't have the touch.
5	One of my favourite places in the Waterloo Region. Fresh ingredients, always consistent, and a taste that keeps bringing me back. Highly recommended.
