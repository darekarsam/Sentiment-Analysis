2	Ok...to begin with, in the 40+ reviews that i have written so far on this website, this is my first rating at 3 or below...maybe i have like one 3!I don't know where to begin with this one. They have a lot of different sweet and savory pies that they advertise on their website. So I was really excited to try out this place. Unfortunately, they didn't have any reviews on yelp and i hadn't come across the slew of negative reviews on another website that i chanced upon later.I tried their beef pasty, which was the DRIEST and most FLAVORLESS pasty ever. Very unfortunately, I ordered a strawberry and cream pie to take to someone's place for dinner. It was at best a B-. I mean the crust (a graham cracker one) was so crumbly that it just fell apart totally. There were some weird shaped globs (literally) of chocolate that covered the pie which made it look really ugly.And btw, if you made it to their store, there are these sorry looking pies staring at you from behind the glass shelf.All in all, stay away.
2	I had a key lime pie here, and it was good. But the two stars is for the mixed berry pie that lacked a bottom crust. I don't know how they did it, but it didn't have a crust on the bottom. Maybe it was magically absorbed by the berries? It was more of a yummy berry goop, but I like my pies to have a full crust. Also, it's pretty expensive...for not having a bottom to your pie.
