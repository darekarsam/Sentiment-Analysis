3	Good mall except there weren't as many stores as you would expect to find in a mall this big. Was really happy though with the amount of different food places you can find here! They have a huge food court upstairs and a lot of other food places around. Stores are clean, mall is clean but I wish that there was more varieties of stores.
3	When I was a child, my mom used to bring me to Alexis Nihon to see Santa Clause over Christmas. There was also a wishing fountain where I would throw in pennies and ask for a million things all within one wish. Ahh... the good ol' days.But now, it's just a mall.You can shop while sipping on your Starbucks coffee. You can eat. You can hide from the freezing cold, or even the scorching summer heat. You can people watch, or even go check out the animals at the Nature Pet Store (that's what I like to do on each of my visits). You know, that sort of thing.
3	I stopped here back in April 2012, the shop center here is okay. The stores in here are okay, but I think this place is good for people watching. We walked around didn't see anything we liked to purchase, we did stop inside the the Nature Pet Store and look at the puppies and rabbits. Starbucks and McDonald's are located at the entrance of the shops -- grab a quick bite or drink here and then maybe do some people watching or go look at the animals.
3	I used to work across the street so it was super convient for me to go to this mall... it's a one stop-shop on your lunch break. But i wouldn't go out of my way to go to this mall if I'm not in the area.
5	I visited this place for the first time this week and I think it is a great place to grab a quick bite and to shop. It's also convenient if you are staying in the city for a bit because they have apartments above mall. So all you have to do is go downstairs do all your shopping and never have to go outside.
