3	Passable, cheap Chinese food. I like the Kung Pao chicken, but they definitely put in too many carrots.
4	Their food is always pretty tasty, although perhaps a little heavily sauce for my tastes, but I'd rather too much sauce than not enough. I'm not a fan of their appetizers much, other than the yummy egg rolls. They make their crab rangoon and fried wonton a little differently than most Chinese joints. The best part is the staff, they are always smiling and friendly, ask how you're doing when you come in, and remember you if you're a regular.
