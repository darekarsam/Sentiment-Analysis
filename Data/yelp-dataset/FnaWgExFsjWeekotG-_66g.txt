2	As far as Wendy's go, it's middle of the pack. They get the order wrong by at least a little bit 1/3 of the time. And calling it "fast" food is kind of comical. But, if you're in Wilkinsburg...well, this place is in Wilkinsburg also. That's about the best I can say. Oh, and everyone is generally polite here. So they've got that going for them.
3	First let me say that I've never stepped foot in this location and plan on keeping it that way.  I'm not one for eating alone in a restaurant, so I usually use the drive thru.Being on Penn Ave in the Point Breeze/Wilkinsburg it's a little tricky to get in and out of this location.  The wait at the drive thru is usually minimal, which is unheard of for drive thrus anywhere.  The staff are polite.  The food is typical for fast food burger places.
2	This is definitely a below average Wendy's although as other have mentioned, your options are limited in this area and this is probably your best bet.  I have experienced long delays here in the drive through (20+ minutes with 5 cars in frort of me to start.)  My order has ultimately been accurately filled though.  The food is normal Wendy's fare.The interior is fine and can get busy at lunchtime.  It is not especially clean, but not egregiously dirty either. On the low end of normal. I have never felt unsafe here.
1	This has got to be the worst fcking Wendy's I have ever been to. They piss me off every time. They always gets orders wrong. Food is not fresh and hot. I would not go there for months and the service is terrible every time. The staff do not greet customers. They do not keep the dining room clean. They frequently run out of condiments and or napkins for the dining area. I would have to say I have received the worst service from there consistently. They just revamped the interior but the service and employees are still terrible.
