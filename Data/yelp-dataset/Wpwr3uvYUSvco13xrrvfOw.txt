4	Fairly new sushi spot on St Denis that definitely calmed my crazy-eyed craving the other day. I'd heard from a neighbour that the stuff was good and I was not disappointed. I ordered one of the chef's combo specials so as not to have to think (one of those days) and it was made fresh, quick in a sparkling clean kitchen. The roe and crab tasted amazingly good for Montreal sushi and the service was super friendly. Will be back for sure!
4	I was impressed by the service. The guy was nice enough to customized my takeout to my needs. Also, their food presentation is fabulous. It shows they have attention to details. The sushi was definitively not bad.
5	Great sushi, friendly service, good value. Highly recommend this place that seems to need more customers.
