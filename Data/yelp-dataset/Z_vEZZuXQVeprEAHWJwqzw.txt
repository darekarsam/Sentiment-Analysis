1	Horrible experience!
1	Awkward...lots of employee issues!  While waiting in the lobby for my financial advisor, I heard the worst gossip from a Sherry lady who I am pretty sure is the boss...here and the older woman behind the desk were bad mouthing the other employees, discussing their physical appearance, joking about someone who just got fired for smoking pot, and being bullies in general.  I was extremely uncomfortable and not sure why they felt it was okay to talk like that about employees or coworkers, much less in front of a client!  The office seemed really unprofessional despite their attempts to have a in a nice office building.  Also, the office carpeting was disgusting and rolled up in areas...everything about this place creeped me out!
5	I've had a very positive experience with Northwestern Mutual as a parent company, this branch, and my advisor, David Mann. My investments have performed well and I'm confident that I have a trusted advisor in my push for financial independence. This relationship is going on a decade as I write this review.
