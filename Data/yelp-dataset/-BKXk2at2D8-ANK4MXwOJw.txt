5	There was no wait and I had a high quality cut for a very reasonable price. Other shops will make you make an appointment days, or even a week in advance. This place is simple and great to bring all the boys to get a cut. Also helped that the boy Beto was a diehard Laker fan like me. Definitely coming back with for business.
5	just the kind of barbershop I was looking for. friendly enviorment. tv's set to sportscenter and some music playing. barbers are courteous and do a good job.
5	Always make the trek across town to see these guys. Space is a little small but they always do a great job and their prices are extremely reasonable. Definitely check these guys out if you're in the area!
1	This place is horrible.  The hours of operation are not listed correctly.  I walked in when they were closed and the guy said he can give me a haircut if I paid double.  They are rude and this place is kind of to Ghetto for me.  I am never going back here again.
