1	This is really for GNC.com; but deals with the overall companyGNC.com lists items that are known to be on backorder and accepts your card and places a order.  They then immediately cancel all the freebie items you qualified for and place an auth on your card.  I placed my order through them and after 2 weeks of waiting called in to cancel my order.  Customer Service then told me that they can not do that since it passed the cancel period.  I think's not.  I'm never giving a penny to them again, store or web-site.  Shop at SupplimentWarehouse.com for a better deal and better customer service.
