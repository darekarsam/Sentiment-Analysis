1	Would definitely not reccomend.   The embroidery did look great... on their 2nd attempt.  BOTH at my cost.   Ordered and paid for 2 shirts to be embroidered 1 week in advance.   Went to pick up and they were screen printed.  I then had to purchase 2 more shirts, at my own expense from target, to be done correctly.   Larry(the owner) gave me a $10 refund for something that cost me almost $70!  Bad business!!  Would not reccomend!!
5	I met Larry, the owner, when my companies new dealership opened. I was looking for some golf hats with our logo embroidered on the band in our Toyota colors. Toyota of Surprise is now looking to him for our retail hat stock.  So easy to work with. My clients, the store GM and parts department director where impressed. If your looking for custom hats, shirts, logos, etc., go see Larry. He knows his stuff and will go to great lengths to make sure you get an end result better than you expected for a very fair cost. Next up; new polos for work and the family reunion. A-1 top shelf. Thanks Larry! P. Nelson
5	I was greeted with a smile and a very attentive ear from Ray...who I later found out owned the company....he generously donated to a charity and I saw him assist a mom with her kids cheerleading outfits...she had a BIG smile on her face!!! Thank you for all you do!!!
