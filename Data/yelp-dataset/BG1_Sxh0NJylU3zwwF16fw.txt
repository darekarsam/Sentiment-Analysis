1	Seriously. This place makes me crazy. It's right by my house and I can never find the time to wash my car so I keep going here, but it freakin' sucks.The first time I went here I tried to do the self wash and the thing ate my money. The second time I went here it was closed even though it says 24 hours. The third and forth time I did the auto wash and it was fine, though you are paying a lot for a really wimpy wash. The fifth time I did the self wash and it was awesome. And I went there just now for a sixth time and they had the second side open which has always been closed before...and I went through that one because someone was in the other side and it takes FOREVER if you have to wait behind someone. So I go through and it just eats my money! The wash never turns on! And there's no one to talk to about it because there's no one there.But I'm desperate because my car is really dirty and I don't have time to go somewhere else, so I back up and pay again to go through the other side and that one's all jacked too! It came on, but it didn't get my car clean AT ALL.So I pull out and I come home and I look up their phone number on the internet and that number is no good! There's seriously no one to talk to about my getting charged $12 and still having a dirty car, so now I have to dispute it with my credit card company.Of course, I suppose that's my fault for continuing to go there knowing how much it sucks.
4	This location has been everything from a BP gas station to a drivethru Rallys/ Checkers hamburger location. It is now a decent little automatic car wash with five do it your self bays and two touch less automatic bays that do a good job. If your vehicle is excessively dirty spray it off in one of the do it yourself bays first and bring your own tire and wheel cleaner so they will be extra clean.
