5	Dr. Johnston, Berday, Tenberg, Sherri, Stephanie and all of the staff are highly professional and friendly toward my little Bebe (~6 year old Chihuahua) when I brought her in after she's been acting abnormal. They assessed her situation, provided a treatment plan for her and informed me on a timely basis. I've been coming back for 4 days and although cost is getting a bit daunting, the services provided are on par with other veterinary clinics I've visited. Definitely recommended !
1	I have been taking my puppy here since he was 7 weeks and I only kept going back because of the wellness plan that we signed him up for but it is NOT WORTH IT!!! You're stuck with making the payments for 12 months and cannot cancel it. It's not even a big discount there's other pet hospitals that charge less, take care of your dogs and not stuck with a contract. DON'T GET THE WELLNESS PLAN!!!! I am never bringing my puppy back again. They tried telling me he needed surgery right away that would've been $5000 and when I got a second opinion they said that he didn't.
1	Unfortunately I got scammed into signing up for their care contract and I am so disappointed with it. EVERY single time I go in they try to upsell me something and tell me it's not covered in the pet care visits. This is the biggest mistake I have ever made. The vet techs leave my dog smelling like cigarettes after they examine them and a couple of them act as though they don't even care. Do not bring your pets here!!
