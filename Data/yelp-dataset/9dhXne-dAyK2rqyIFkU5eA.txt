5	Dan and his crew did an amazing job on the tile in my showroom.  They cleaned and color sealed the tile and it is 1000% better.  Still looks as good today as the day they did it.  I would highly recommend it to anyone with old, dirty, grout!
5	After having my office tiled, I found that the grout was nowhere near the color it should have been and did not match the grout color throughout the rest of my house, Dan did a great job staining and sealing my freshly installed grout. I couldn't be more pleased and would highly recommend his company.
5	We've been exploring options to clean up out grout for years. I made a phone call to the owner, Dan, and he quickly returned my call within 24 hours. He thoroughly explained their process that consists of 2 rounds of deep cleaning tile/grout, hand staining/sealing all grout, and hand washing the entire floor afterwards. The initial estimate was very fair and this is exactly what we paid. Dan and Tyler were able to come out very soon after our initial call, send a color pallette beforehand, and showed up on time Saturday morning. Our downstairs consisted of approximately 800-900 sq ft and the job took from 730am-130pm. We were so happy with the results that we have them scheduled to come back and do all of the upstairs tile/grout. Dan & Tyler are extremely friendly and we felt safe with them in our home. They left aftercare instructions and even recommended a cleaning product for our appliances that were damaged by a previous floor cleaner. By the way, that product is Bar Keepers Friend and totally cleaned up our appliances to looking brand new. Thanks for that too guys!! We highly recommend these services to everyone who desires to have immaculate tile floors.
