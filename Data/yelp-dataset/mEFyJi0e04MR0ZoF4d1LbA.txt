The small staff are always helpful and friendly.I have had things shipped, packed, faxed and copied and I never had a problem as they are there to assist you.I can get to my box after hours and they don't mind if you call to see if you have a package.The candy bowl is a plus too.
5	Simple, yet great experience here. Went to buy a box, and decided to have them pack it for me as well. It was 1/2 the price for the same exact service as FedEx Kinkos.

Both the lady and gentleman who are working at the front counter were so nice and friendly and helpful!  Their customer service is exceptional and their prices are very good. They definitely go the extra mile to help their customers.  I will definitely be coming back here!  Great find.Service with a smile. Fast, easy, transaction. Plenty of parking in front of the store. All around great experience!
