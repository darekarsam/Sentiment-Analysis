5	I use this company all the time, and boy was I surprised when I found they provide mobile massage services in Las Vegas! They came right to my hotel room on the strip and of course the mobile massage therapist did a great deep tissue massage, that got all my knots out and made me feel great!  My friend had a mobile pedicure at the same time, she really enjoyed it.  This company is very professional and the Massage therapists are always incredible, I have also used this company for corporate chair massage at my business and again, they were awesome. I will definitely be booking them again, next time for a spa party, which I know will be awesome.  I highly recommend this company to anyone looking for a in room massage, in home massage or mobile spa services. They excel at everything they do, and they are very easy to book with.
