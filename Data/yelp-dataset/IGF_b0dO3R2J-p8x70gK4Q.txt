3	This company was better when the father (William Wessner) owned and managed it. I bought both an AC system and high efficiency furnace from them. Since his two sons have taken over the business, it has gone downhill. Now when the service man comes to inspect and clean your system, it seems like he's always trying to find something wrong, even when everything is operating just fine. As a result, I've stopped getting checkups done.
