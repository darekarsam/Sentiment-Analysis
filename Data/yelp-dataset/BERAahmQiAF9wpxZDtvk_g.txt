3	Decent chinese food while on your lunch hour. $5.15 lunch specials. Nothing to rave about, but a decent meal for a good price.
4	Wonderfully fresh food that is tasty and well prepared.  If you eat in, they bring it to you and she has service with a smile.  I had the Sesame beef and it was to die for. My grandson kept eating off my plate after he ate all his egg rolls.  Family had different rices and they were great as well.  Ate there again and had Orange Chicken.  Was wonderful and I was mad I could not eat it all.  Great and pleasant dining experience.
5	AMAZING food!! I'm from out of town and my aunt recommended this place and it was soooo good!! I will defiantly be coming back when I'm in town!!! They were fast and very polite over the phone. They even give us a treat which are these yummy sugar donuts!!
2	Seriously? I must have come on an off day.Other reviews sing high praises of this place, I'm not getting it.My food was bland like I had a head cold, no flavor at all. I was worried when my hot sour soup was nether hot or sour.And how rude is it the owners children where playing in the dinning area? The counter person was very nice, that's about it.
5	Great place awesome food. So much had to take some home!Staff is friendly. Dine in she brought it out. Good prices for the amount of food
