4	That stretch of Bernard avenue in Outremont can have a reputation of being a bit pretentious and stuck up. I'm glad that there are few players in the classic cast of restaurants to keep that area in check by providing and producing wholesome and honest food. Amelios sur Bernard's staff is inviting, friendly and always has a second to chit chat no matter how busy they are. Food tastes better when its cooked with the intension of wanting you to eat it, rather than wanting you to squeeze your wallet for it.
3	Consider this as more of a post-mortem review as this location has sadly closed.I liked the location, the outdoor terrace snuggled between buildings a la Paris, the pizza and pasta is not the best I've ever had (that goes to Artizan), but you can't argue with the price and the quality is undeniable.I love it when food is so hot you can tell it's not re-heated, waiting a few minutes for the food to cool down is a delight. I'm trying to find causes for their closing:-the basement location is a bit cramped-when terrace season is over, so is the business it generates-the prices could not keep up with the costs of doing business here-the clientele could be cold to something they consider cheap and lowbrow-the menu is not very varied, subs-pizza and pasta, not much in terms of side dishes.-not well known, some tourists were asking me for directions and I did not know there was a location there and I know most restos in the area pretty wellI never tried the one in the Mcgill Ghetto, but maybe they have regulars they've built over the years, could be that the clientele in Outremont is quite different than students with munchies who's only other options is Madonna's  99 cent slices.I'll have to try the other location as it's quite revered, hope another low priced eatery appears in it's place here.
