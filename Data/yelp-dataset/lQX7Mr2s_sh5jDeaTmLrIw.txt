2	A few thoughts....If you're accessing this review on a mobile phone while driving.....here's a quick tip: KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE ROAD!   Who will be the eventual Duke of 215 Beltway: a construction worker or some douchebag ticket-writing cop?  It should be the homeless guy at the exit ramp, but doubt he will have the Yelp app let alone mobile phone to check-inFun fact#1: the proper name for the beltway is the Bruce Woodbury Beltway, keep that in your back pocket when you get onto JeopardyFun fact#2: the first number of any three digit interstate designates if it deviates from the primary highway (odd) or if it forms a loop to reconnect (even)- this is the one that will get you the hot chick's number at the barDropping the metaphorical microphone onto the ground- friends don't let friends check-in and drive.

Drivers, however, scare the crap outta Monkey due to the utter lack of consideration for other drivers. The 215 is far better idea than Blue Diamond Rd with its 55mph speed limits between traffic lights a mile apart and grocery stores alongside.
5	Lol. Okay. Riddle me this, why is it that where you park is called the drive way and where you drive is a parkway? Nevermind that. that was too complicated. 215 takes you just about anywhere around Vegas, excerpt the Strip. That's what the 95 is for. It's also practically a big "U" so you'll come around.. Or get lost and end up in Kanye's Flashing Lights music video.. Eventually. Click it or ticket? Yelp it and check in!
3	This was the only part of the expressway in Las Vegas where I could say that you never encounter any traffic, but I will not be able to say that much longer. Once the Shoppes at Summerlin open up it is going to be a mess over here. If you live in West Park say hello to Shopping Center traffic all day long. The holiday shopping season and the weekends are going to be a nightmare.
