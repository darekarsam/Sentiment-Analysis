5	I LOVE LOVE LOVE this boutique! I got the cutest purse here! My girls love their hair accessories and little purses! You have to stop by here and shop! You won't find better prices!
5	My girlfriend loves this place.  The owner is very helpful when I have purchased jewelery for my girl.  It is nice to have a boutique here instead of the typical Walmart and Target!
5	Great place to shop. Very friendly and best prices.  I will be back.
5	Love love love this place & Judy is so sweet i just love her!
5	This store is great! You can get inexpensive but still nice versions of fashion clothes. There is something for everyone here. The even have some larger sized but still trendy clothes. They have copies of a lot of high fashion and runway looks. They have tons of accessories. This is a great place to bring your teenager and set her loose to create her own look.
