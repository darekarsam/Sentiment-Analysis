3	I have to admit I liked Garcia's pizza.  Its not fancy or glamorous, but you can buy it by the slice and that makes a difference for lunch sometimes.  This place was never busy, so I did whatever I did that past for studing sometimes here.  The interior was nice and roomie and had and interesting set of furniture.  The crust was cruncy (not crisp on the bottom and doughy, really unique actually.  So unique in fact, occassionally I would get a specific craving, which is always a good sign.  The sauce was very tomato-y.  Good pizza, by the slice.  Cheap.  I can't argue.  I'd give it a 3.5 but must round down.
4	Best Pizza in Illinois outside of Chicago! It's all about the crust which has an amazing flavor! I just get cheese pizza here the crust needs little to dress it up. I've in fact driven 140 miles just to get this pizza. I'll admit to a little nostalgia being involved, but who can put a price on that?! You just can't go wrong with the Flying Tomato Brothers!
4	My first date with my wife was a the Garcia's pizza in Normal, IL in 1979 near Waterson Towers.  I later found out that Garcia's closed in Normal when I was celebrating my 20th wedding anniversary.  We drove to Champaign and told them that we met 20 years earlier and they gave us our meal free for being so loyal.  I went to school at the U of I in Champaign and my wife went to school in Normal at ISU.  Garcia's have the best pizza outside of Chicago.
