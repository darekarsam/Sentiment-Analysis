3	My Pittsburgh friend says that this is her fave store.  Well, as far as high fashion goes, this is it for Pittsburgh.  Tiny selection of some higher end designers, Dolce and Gabbana, Lanvin, Tory Burch....a small selection of shoes (even some Prada).  A selection of nice jewelry and a good selection of knits.  They had one of my fave knitwear company's, Inhabit .  A bigger selection than I had seen anywhere.  I bought a few of those, so I guess it is my fave store in Pittsburgh, too.
2	Not really for females under 45.
1	This store is shameful to the Shadyside family. Upon entering the shop, the blond sales associate judged my friend and I by staring at us and abruptly walking away without a greeting. My friend was given dirty looks form the elderly sales associate while I tried to ignore the rudeness and enjoy the clothing. I am not complaining about the prices, I have bought many items from the same designers and enjoy the designers quality, I was not sticker shocked. What I am upset about is the customer service by these women who think it is okay to treat potential customers with such disrespect. Neither me friend nor I were dressed poorly, we are both fashion stylist in the Pittsburgh area. I have never been so disrespected in my life and after writing this review I will be contacting the owner.
1	So I wrote a review but it was filtered. I think people should know how awful this place is before stepping inside. I have no ties to this place; I don't know any of the other owners of shops in Shadyside and I am 100% un-bias and wrote my review purely on my experience there. Why was it filtered?
5	Wow! I can't believe I found this store in Pittsburgh! Amazing  clothing brands like Alaia, GIVENCHY, Lanvin, The Row...their designer list is endless! I can not believe the shoes and the jewelery was amazing...Irene Neuwirth, Monique Pean, Jennifer Meyer etc... Who would of thought in Pittsburgh? I will definitely be back on my next visit!!
