2	This store is very quiet....quite small if you ask me....there is limited selection in several items....other then that it's a typical office max
1	The print shop is probably the worst run printer in office max lineup. Shoddy work that they regularly have to redo and they never call you when it's done like they say they will. Incompetence is the norm here.
5	I recently moved to Charlotte and needed my resume for an interview. I went here to get some printed. Although I did have to wait a long time till it was my turn the lady (don't know her name but she had braids and a hat on) there was very helpful and went the extra mile to make sure I had what I needed when it was my turn and that I left satisfied. If I could do it over I wouldn't change a thing besides Next time I'll go earlier in the day. But they really should have someone else back there helping her. The store wasn't that busy I think someone else would make things go faster. I know she was doing the best she could. Thank you!
