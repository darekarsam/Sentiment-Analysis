5	I've taken 3 vehicles into Andy over the past 5 years and he has the best customer service along with the best prices in time and you are in and out inNo time. You don't have to leave your car overnight. Same day service. I have put a lot of money into my modified 350Z, and Andy is the only guy that could wire my car the first time and get it right when everybody else in town crash and burned.  I had a radar detector hard wired into my car and it only took Andy no more than 30 minutes to do and it was a total success. I would highly recommend 12 Volt Solutions to everybody before taking your car elsewhere. His customer service, low prices, and quality of his work is phenomenal and you will not regret it. Patty
5	I have had numerous cars done there from personal to even my own customers vehicles and never had an issue...Andy has went out of his way to fix issues one being an electrical draw which was a real nightmare and he resolved it quickly..I have the utmost confidence in their ability to fix/resolve issues as well as their installation....
5	For once, I am going to "join the crowd" and make it unanimous.Larry is honest as they come. I told him my sub wolfer had "had it", and that's all I want.He gave me choices and did not pressure me, or try to up sell me, more than what I needed. I didn't pick the cheapest, just what I thought would be match my amplifier, and was very satisfied. His prices are not the cheapest, but he's honest and does quality work.I will be back for more work, this time on my Jeep Liberty.
