4	I went in to Audion Express to buy my wife a new radio, had gone in with visions of what she wanted.  While there my wife let me know that she actually wanted something else.  Jose Moreno took care of us and got my wife what she wanted and showed her how to use everything afterwards.  We did test calls to make sure she knew how to use her new blue tooth system and Jose made sure she was comfortable with how things were setup before she left.  I'm looking at taking my work truck there now to get a few upgrades myself.  System works great - happy wife, happy life.
5	I ran into some trouble with my stereo system and stopped in here to get some help. They were all great but Joey really did a great job fixing it for me excellent customer service!!
5	Came into excited to make a purchase and Jose Moreno helped me and i got a great deal today! Highly recommend this place.
5	I needed a security and remote for my second hand car that I just got..These guys got me in, gave me a great deal..Dominic and his team were very educational and took the time to explain everything to me as well as dream build for other things I wanted to add on to my other vehicle. .prices were very fair..The lounge was clean..football game was ok..
