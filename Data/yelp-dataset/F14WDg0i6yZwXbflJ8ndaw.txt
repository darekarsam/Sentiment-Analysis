2	Pizza is great but service is crap. waited 10-15 min with 4 ppl in front of me to order a slice! of pizza then another 10-15 to get it. then u have to go search for water and napkins in the food park. not to mention trying to find a place to sit and eat the 7 yes 7 dollar slice of just peperoni pizza. no common sense is practiced here.
5	Service was excellent both times that I've ordered a whole pie to go.  The first time, it was a short 15 minute wait, the second time I waited just 2 minutes for my meat lovers pizza as they gave me one straight out of the oven that was headed for their "pizza by the slice" counter.  The staff was friendly and polite.
5	Hard choosing a place to eat when you're on the strip with young kids. You can't go wrong with pizza (though not my personal first choice.) Was walking through Caesars and saw DiFara. Ordered a whole meat pizza for the family. Honestly the BEST food court or restaurant quality pizza I've tasted. Worth a try whether you are looking for something fast or just plain delicious pizza!
