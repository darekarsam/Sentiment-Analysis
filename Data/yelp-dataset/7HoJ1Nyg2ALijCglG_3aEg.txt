4	Wow! This place popped up overnight!  This trendy, casual concept is part coffee bar ~ part wine bar, with the look and feel of one of those cool spots at the airport.  In the wine bar area, their main food is tapas but they do have limited sandwiches, a salad and a couple of desserts.  I tried the V95 dates that were wrapped in prosciutto and stuffed with goat cheese with a little honey. Delicious!  The longer I sat in the wine bar area, the more I felt like I was on vacation.  What a nice alternative spot to take a break at the mall without a long time commitment.
3	I was there on Black Friday.Staff was extremely friendly, but clearly working out the kinks of the new place.Ordered the dates wrapped in prosciutto stuffed with goat cheese.  They were so-so.  Ate more than half before even getting my wine. :(Ordered a to-go coffee, and it took them 20 minutes to realize it was made, on the counter getting cold.  They offered me a glass of wine to make it up to me.  I took them up on it. :)This is a nice alternative to what is offered in the food court.I will try again the next time I'm at Fashion Square.  I really want it to be amazing, I have hope!
1	Asked for 3 different red wines, they were out of all 3 and instead offered one that was almost double the price, without my knowledge - then proceeded to be rude about giving me the price of one of the 3 that I originally requested - as far as I'm concerned if you don't have more than 50% of your red wine list in stock, then you should offer the price of the more reasonably priced glasses - seemed like a bait and switch to me -
