5	Aria was the stuff of legend.  World class bookings.  Montreal crowd.  Padded dancefloor.  Lights show up from the dancefloor.  Six deck DJ booth.  Moving lights on trusses.  VJs.  Long hours.  Very long hours.  It was a place which brought out the best in many a of my favorite DJ.  Aria was scoffed at by Sona (RIP) faithful and Stereoheads (RIP Stereo.)  But this Yank loved it.  I once called it "the best big room in North America" and I was right.  My favorite Aria memory -- Danny Howells longest set ever was here July 2003.  Danny played into the afternoon and the lighting guy even tapped out, leaving the last hour's revelry for the odd bathing of the house lights.  He didn't even know he was booked for a marathon but he ate it up.  Danny vs Montreal was a great relationship which was truly made that night.  A taste of that finale -- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6CYLddHwgg_C$
