5	Standard Kohl's, but cleaner and more organized than other Kohls I've been in in the past. Also, they have a great big and tall section, which I noticed some Kohls have scaled back on. I appreciate the bigger selection, as its very hard to find big and tall, and at good prices. The evening manager, not sure his name, just gave us a great deal as there was some confusion regarding a coupon that had been causing difficulty for the store employees (it was a 3rd party coupon.) I appreciated him rectifying the situation and taking care of us! Awesome customer service is what will keep us going to this location.
