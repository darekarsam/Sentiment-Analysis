4	More boutique shopping, you say? Yes, please! Lipp is one of the newest chic boutiques to hit Crown Town. Nestled in the shops at the Metropolitan, this boutique offers clothing, shoes and accessories from the $30-$300 price point. You'll find dresses in the $70-$250 price range, tops $60-$180, shoes $50-$120, and accessories $20-$100. Styles range from modern to girlie Southern. I witnessed a nice mix of both super colorful items and sharp black options. The boutique is organized nicely with a beautiful, cozy layout...all which lends itself well to perusing the racks. Whether you're searching for a specific party dress or a just checking out the goods, the staff here are incredibly helpful and sweet. A few brands I spied while shopping here:-BB Dakota-Ark & Co.-RD International-Paige-Genetic-Hudson-French ConnectionI also heard that Lipp is planning on bringing more brands into their product mix like Diesel and Nation Ltd...hooray! I'm looking forward to heading back when they add more and more to their store. Smooches, Lipp.
3	Lipp is my idea of a mediocre boutique. Don't expect  the complementary champagne and wine or the fashionista employees helping you put together the perfect  look . The shoes are cute,  however nothing different than what you would see at Dillard's or Macy's. There is a nice mix of clothing options from dresses , tunics, blouses and denim.  The jewelry is the standout star in this boutique! The jewelry consists of amazing pieces you will not find else where. I would say this place is perfect for someone needing a last minute outfit or dress. You can definitely find something hot to wear at Lipp, just don't expect the royal treatment  other boutiques offer.
4	I'm a big fan of Lipp. Yeah, they can be pricey but the array of clothing should make any woman happy. I've purchased several items here including a red snake skin purse which I just love. The jewelry is amazing. I really need to stay away from this place!
