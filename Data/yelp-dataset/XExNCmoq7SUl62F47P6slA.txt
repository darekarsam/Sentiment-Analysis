3	After years of driving by this place, I finally stopped by this past weekend. There was not a soul there on a Sunday afternoon, which can either be really good if you want to take a walk and collect your thoughts or bad if there is a serial killer around (I watch too much CSI)Interesting little park though. It has a basketball court, a huge field mostly used for soccer and some walking trails. It's right across the street from the Metropolitan and you could probably hear some live music over there on Thursdays during the summer. The parking schematics is just weird. There is one place to enter and exit and it has a huge, sketchy lot a little more south on Kenilworth filled with trash and who knows what and you think you can go in there and get out but it turns out to be a dead end. Park=clean. Parking lot=nasty.

I almost hate to give people a chance to find this park because I enjoy having it all to myself to practice kicking the soccer ball around.  There usually aren't too many people except when they have lacrosse games in the evening.There is another park right next door called Baxter park which adds to the total park space available.  The field is pretty good.  The next door basketball court is OK, but the surface rough stone since the original surface has been worn off.  The lines are barely visible.There is a cool civil rights memorial with audio that tells about the civil rights struggle.  Nice and tall mature trees are abundant.The only downside is that the fringes of the park are totally overgrown and the parking lot is atrocious.  The vibrant black neighborhood that was nearby years ago and that used the park back then has been replaced with freeways and parking lots and sterile plazas so must people will arrive at this park via automobile.
