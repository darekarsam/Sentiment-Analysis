2	It is due only to my laziness that this is my first review of Morazan (South Blvd location). During our first two visits, the experience was tremendous - a lot of tasty food for the money and excellent service by our waiter (perhaps owner?), who introduced himself as Mario and shook hands all around. He was friendly, patient as we perused the extensive menu, and attentive. *That* review would've been 5 stars. We (a family of four adults) returned tonight, and it felt like a Twilight Zone episode...but not one of the good ones. Everything looked the same and the food was still high quality; however, the server had morphed from the esteemed Mario to an 18(?)-year-old who perhaps started his career in the restaurant industry, say, earlier today. He seemed to have not been trained at all. It was not only that he lacked significant social skills, but his poor attention/ memory caused us to get some (minor) incorrect food...even after another server came back to confirm part of the order. But the biggest problem was simply that he clearly had no interest in his job. This included ignoring our party for most of the evening while chatting with the 5+ female servers. So, two stars tonight. Please bring back Mario and I will gladly increase this to a 5-star rating.
