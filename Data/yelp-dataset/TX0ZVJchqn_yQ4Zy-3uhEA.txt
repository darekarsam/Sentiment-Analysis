5	Alex has been trimming my trees for years working for the other guys. I have been telling him for years that he needs to go out on his own, now that he has I'm an All Star customer. I do and will recommend his work to anyone!Ken Gilbert Arizona
1	After only six months of being my monthly yard guy, Alex showed true colors of poor business ethics by agreeing to an extra yard cleaning project and taking payment in full up front only to complete a portion of the project and never returning. After many texts from Alex giving one excuse after another and leaving me hanging that he or his team would be out to finish, now two weeks later the project remains unfinished and now texts or phone calls are not being returned. Very unsatisfactory business practices. I have reported this to the BBB.
1	In the beginning, Alex & Co were great to deal with.  They came to my house in a timely manner, provided a quick and fair quote, and came by the next day to complete my landscaping project.I came home from work to find my glass door had been shattered.  This was AFTER I had handed them cash + tip.I immediately contacted Alex and he said he would help me remedy the issue.  I am not unreasonable, and suggested I would accept additional lawn care in lieu of cash.  He said he would get back to me.After 3+ weeks of NO RESPONSE, he finally responds and says he is no longer part of the company, and that I was on my own.
