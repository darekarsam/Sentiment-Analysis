1	End product was great and we love the tile but I will never use them again due to the lack of communication on their part. I am the paying customer and I shouldn't have to keep checking in to see when my tile has been ordered, when they will come out and and install and then guess what time they are showing up the morning of. That is their job to keep their customers informed.
1	Facts; They will cut corners in every way. Materials, labor, and skipping critical steps during the process. Like not painting or at least priming walls prior to new finish materials. Covering up mold on existing walls. I took pictures of their tile guy using blue masking tape to cover large gaps in drywall pryer to tiling  them.  Abusive to employees, suppliers, and customers.
