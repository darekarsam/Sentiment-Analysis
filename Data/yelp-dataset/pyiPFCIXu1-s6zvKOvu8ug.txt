5	Great place. Best indoor playset.
4	What a wonderful franchise!  They do it all well:  service, employee attitude, cleanliness, food quality, amenities and efficiency.This is a southern thing and it is so good.  All chicken stuff, sit in or drive through.  The drive through is almost always loaded.  Two lanes and waiters walking down the waiting line of cars taking orders and calling them in.  Very efficient and quick.When you walk in the employees are uniformed and clean.  Managers have on ties or a different shirt and they are on the line watching and helping.  You order and can just take a seat, which is very helpful to a mom and children coming for a meal.  Your order will be delivered to your table.Employees circulate the dining area asking if you would like a drink refill or anything else and they actually take your beverage to the counter, have it filled and return it to you.  Gee!The play area, as JB elaborated in his lengthy review, is super.  A glass wall allows parents to watch the play area and basically adults are not permitted entry, but sometimes one needs to capture an happy child in order to leave the restaurant and that is OK.They recently added some wonderful doughy, yeasty biscuits each containing a pure white meat fried nugget of chicken.  Man o Man, three of those little darlings with a cup of decent coffee is a fine way to activate your drowsing body for the day.Southern hospitality is practiced and is sincere.  This franchise wants you as a continuing customer and it shows.And they are closed on Sundays, even at airport and mall locations.  Kudos to Chick-fil-A for standing up for something in our ever manic society.
