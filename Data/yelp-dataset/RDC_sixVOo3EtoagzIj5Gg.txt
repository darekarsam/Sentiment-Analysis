5	The best polish sausage you can find outside of Poland! Gourmet sausage & Pierogis that are handmade daily, you can taste the freshness and the love put into this food!
5	Best hand made sausage you can find in Vegas. I come down here by atomic for work just about every weekend and this is my spot for lunch. Everything is homemade and the quality is outstanding. From bier brats to polish sausage, burgers, and even pierogis, you can't got wrong.
5	You will read many positive reviews here so let me just say these two things:1. The burgers are as good as or possibly better than the sausages.  I recommend you try several burgers and several of each of the sausages and make your own determination.  For me it's a mood thing, but I'll tell you what, the burgers edge out the sausages lately.  (The pierogi are delightful as well, if you're extra-hungry or can share I say add on an order of those, you will be quite satisfied).2. Jerry himself is a hoot.  He clearly knows what he's doing and he's an interesting character from whom you want to purchase food no matter how many pints you've consumed.  From Poland by way of Chicago... more street cred than Abe Froman if you ask me.So there you have it.  Swing by Atomic Liquor or now visit the Velveteen Rabbit on Sunday nights (Check with Jerry on his current and future schedules) and check out some of the best burger/sausage/pierogi action you'll find in Vegas.
