4	Quiet. Clean. Modern. Minimalst.  Great weekend price of 50 euros single. Bathroom is in a cool, plastic , quarter circle of your room, and air conditioner works well. Friendly reception. I will definitely be back. Exit to the right of the train station at the main entrance, and walk about five minutes and you cannot miss the building. It's in a former building of the German Post Office. Overall, a great experience. I booked via www.hrs.com
