3	I visited and fell in love with their food hall at Elm Row. I'd walked past what had initially felt like a mediocre street only to discover the most impressive deli I've seen in Edinburgh! They had all sorts of cheeses, olive oil, cold cut meats, pasta, sauces, and many more deliciously delectable things. I had great hopes for this Valvona and Crolla, situated in THE department store of the city centre, Jenners. I was sadly disappointed to find it has much less character than the rustic and homey store on Elm Row. You will still find great food that I was impressed by the other store, and perhaps even more as they have an American Food section, with the popular staples such as Pop Tarts and Aunt Jemima mixes and syrups.There is an adjoining restaurant with fantastic views over and beyond Princes Street, and two smaller cafes, one in the food hall, and another on a lower floor by the men's clothes section.The food here is a little pricier than going to a supermarket as would be expected, but for a foodie like me, it's well worth it. Just go to the Elm Row one instead. Nuff said.
3	I can only comment on the second floor Cafe overlooking Princess Street. I haven't bought anything from the deli.Decent coffee and a well stocked chocolate counter means you can get something fairly tasty to sit along side your caffeine fix. Down sides include fairly small cups and a problem finding seats. Last couple of  times I've been in there was no space but (and here's my big issue) there were at least four members of staff from the store having their morning cuppas.  Don't want to sound like an HR tyrant but I'd get the staff a decent place to have their breaks so customers can get a coffee and a shopping break.
