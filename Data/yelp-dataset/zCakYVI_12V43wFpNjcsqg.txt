1	Bad, bad service. Check this laundry business on the Better Business Bureau website.  It's rated C-.
5	Great service! I bought a Groupon and had a Prada purse with flowers on the side cleaned. They did a great job and even went through a second clean to make sure all the dirty spots are removed. They also do delivery and pickup
1	I used this service to wash and iron my linens after Christmas in 2011.  Their service was good and they did a great job on the linens.  They requested a credit card for payment, which I gave them.  It is now August 2013 and twice my credit card has been charged for services I did not receive.  The first time I called and they removed the fees.  This time I have called three times.  They responded after the second call that they would check the charge and get back to me.  That was 10 days ago.  Still have not responded and charge is still on my card.
