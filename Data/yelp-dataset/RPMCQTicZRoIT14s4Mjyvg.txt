5	ASK FOR AL MANGER, he was awesome!  VERY very through, he leaves no stone unturned.Al inspected a house for us that we ended up not getting and then we used him again just recently for our latest house in escrow.  He did yet another spectacular job and answered all my annoying questions.  He is thorough, good for a buyer, not for a seller.  Affordable.  602-738-6604www.pillartopost.com
5	We were very impressed by the professionalism by our inspector Woody.  He showed up on time and was very detailed in his inspection of the house.  He took time to stop what he was doing and answer any questions we had and also engaged us to show us things he found.  When he was done, he completed entering details into his computer, and then printed out a summary of his findings. We hung out in the kitchen as he went over them with us and was happy to answer any questions we had, or offer some advice when we had concerns.  Great home inspection experience!!
