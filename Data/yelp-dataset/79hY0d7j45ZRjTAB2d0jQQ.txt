2	Ugggh I hate this subway.  I hate it the most of any subway I have ever been in, including those I've been to in gas stations.  Especially given that Silvermine is right next door, I would never, ever go here except that I really like the subway tuna salad wraps and the silver mine tuna salad just can't compete.  The vast majority of the employees I have encountered at this particular franchise have been either cross-eyed (no joke) or unwilling to interrupt their cell phone conversations to make me a sandwich.The best part about this subway is that if it weren't so terrible, I probably never would have tried silver mine, and silver mine is awesome.
1	I agree, quite likely the worst Subway on the planet. The employees do not care 1% about you, or your order. I'd rather have a sandwich from the dining hall in all seriousness. Don't waste your time, even if you crave Subway - because this location will make sure you never crave it again.
1	I agree with the previous two reviewers. I've shown up here 5 times for breakfast after my 10 AM class ~around 10:53... every time except for once when they had a pretty reasonable employee, the people here have come up with some lame excuse to avoid making me a breakfast sub. (Breakfast subs are available from 7-11)Silvermine next door is so much better.
