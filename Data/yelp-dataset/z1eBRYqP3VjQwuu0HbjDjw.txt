4	Cafe Pan is tucked away from the main shopping street and located in a backyard, providing a quiet and relaxed environment away from the hustle and bustle - and the construction works - in the city centre. This restaurant or coffee shop specialises in crepes and I enjoyed the tasty crepe I had there. I wonder that I was not there earlier, despite living in this city for a few years, I never made it into this backyard before I moved away some years ago.  If you are in Karlsruhe and you like crepes, make sure you check out Cafe Pan.
