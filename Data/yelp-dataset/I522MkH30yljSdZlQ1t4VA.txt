3	Just like I remember it with the skinny hot dogs with snappy skins, unlike the larger Nathan hot dogs at Sam's Club food court. Available plain or with chili. Free topping bar has sauerkraut and sauteed onions. Starting around $3 for a hot dog so not exactly cheap eats.This location also has a Arthur Treacher's Fish & Chips though I didn't try it.
4	The first time I had Nathan's was in New York on Coney Island. You can't eat one in Downtown Pittsburgh and get the same results. The boardwalk, the rides, the ocean, the sand, and the smells of Coney Island are all part of the experience.What do I love about the natural casing dogs? The snap when you bite into it, the heavy garlic that Nathan's uses in their recipe, and what's better than a bigger than the bun weiner? Who needs the carbs? Slather on some dark mustard, some chopped onion and you got a meal fit for a ..... Coney Island Freak! On Coney Island these cost a little under three bucks, 2 for 5.25. Not bad for New York.One draw back about being vegan, they don't make a vegan Nathan's dog!
3	It's a tasty dog, but a bit pricey as others have mentioned. I've been to the Nathan's in other cities so I guess this is comparable in taste and price...although maybe I don't mind the cost in other cities, b/c I'm usually in an airport and fully expect them to rip me off. But come on downtown Pittsburgh - $4.00 for a hot dog with some toppings?!?! All in all an "A-OK" experience. I may or may not go there again - I really have no strong feelings about it...I guess it will depend on if I feel like splurging for a h-dog! If you're in the area and have an abundance of $$$ and don't mind spending it on encased meat then stop by.
