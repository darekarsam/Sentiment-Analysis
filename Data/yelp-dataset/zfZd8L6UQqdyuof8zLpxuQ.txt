5	I was very pleased with my visit today in the store. My wife and I were there just to check out the store and they had more than I was expecting. Their beer kits are a great value and they also have all the separate ingredients to put together your own recipe. I will be coming in again the next time I need to buy something.
5	I've been using this store regularly since it opened late last year. They carry a wide variety of grains ( I've never brought in an all grain recipe they couldn't fill!) in a clean, friendly environment. Always helpful staff, with answers to most questions, and tips on  better brewing....Wonderful to have such a resource in  North Scottsdale
