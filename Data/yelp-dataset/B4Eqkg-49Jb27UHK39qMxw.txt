5	I just had the best interview with Ms Townsend.  Not only was she kind, she was just brilliant in the analysis of my employment issue. Even though I was calling for a friend, and from out of state, she took the time to direct me (and my friend) to another attorney who could best serve our needs.
5	I was referred to Marilyn Townsend by another attorney.  During my initial consultation she was very upfront and informative with me regarding my case and the possible outcomes and concessions I would have to make if I wanted to pursue it.  I never felt pressured to chose her as my attorney.  I hired her because I believed she was the right individual for the job.  She came across as a very strong, independent, intelligent woman, an individual with enough guts and glory to stand up for me against my former employer and whatever attorney they might hire and not back down.  Sometimes you need an attorney that can be condescending, dismissive, or possibly even rude!   This was a very difficult time for me and Ms. Townsend was very respectful and compassionate.  She handled my case professionally and quickly.  Needless to say we won.  I have since referred two other individuals that were also pleased with Ms. Townsend's services.
