5	I am a basically very novice in the gun world but I do have a love for shooting and owning some guns.  The staff at Level Up is friendly, knowledgeable, and there to help. Unlike some other stores, everyone at Level up is approachable and there to help you. I get all my guns from the store and feel that it is the best in Henderson and Vegas!  I highly recommend this store!
5	Bought my gun recently at the store.  Great staff, very helpful.  The owner, Tim, was also working as he is there on Saturdays, and he gave me some great pointers in helping to make my decision on which gun to purchase.  Highly recommend the store for any gun enthusiasts and newbies too.
5	Plan to purchase my first handgun here. Very nice gun store with a friendly owner who is willing to help you along the journey to finding your perfect gun. Will recommend to anyone!
