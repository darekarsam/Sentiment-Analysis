5	We used Handyman Matters to get our rental unit in shape after our previous tenants basically decided to hang every conceivable picture in their arsenal. Needless to say, the walls of the house looked like Swiss cheese. The previous tenants also took the liberty of breaking a bathroom faucet (still trying to figure that one out). Greg, our handyman, got to our rental unit right on time and after showing him the damage, he immediately went to work patching up the holes, replacing the faucet and making the house look like new. That guy most definitely knew his craft and earned his keep that day. This is the second time I've used Handyman Matters for my repairs and even though they are under new management, they exceeded my expectations once again! Thank you to everyone at HmM. You made the tribulations of being a landlord more manageable.
5	I have used handyman matters several times now. They are always very professional and punctual. I would highly recommend them forall of your repairs and improvements.
5	I have used Handyman Matters several times. And I will continue to use them. From my smallest problems to my newest ideas, they have been great. Most recent, I had Gregory widen a doorway and put in French doors. He did a fantastic job. I would recommend them to anyone!!!
