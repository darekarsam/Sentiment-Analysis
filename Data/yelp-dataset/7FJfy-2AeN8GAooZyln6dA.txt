4	I had great Malaysian chicken here, to die for.This is not an inexpensive place, but that was the best main course I have ever eaten.
5	Fantastic fusion food. Their sushi is spot on: not just the regular sushis you find, but a nice variety all freshly made. Their Thai steak is also delicious, you have to try it.
1	If you enjoy patronizing a restaurant that appears to value arrogance, greed and being a jerk above all else, this is the place for you. Can't comment in the food: we were treated so badly in the first minute there was no point staying. I've dined all over the world , and this topped any bad experience I've had anywhere. A new standard in treating the customer with contempt was reached. I'm still amazed.
