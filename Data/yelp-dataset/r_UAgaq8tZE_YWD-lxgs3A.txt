4	This is one of B&N's newest locations in Pittsburgh.  You can park on either side of the major parking lots in Settlers Ridge Shopping complex, and it isn't hard to miss.  The sales floor is both spacious but compact.  There's plenty of seating spaces but at the same time the whole thing feels cozy.Sales staff is friendly and for the most part the clientele present doesn't get in the way of reading on-site.  There is a Starbucks slash bakery but it doesn't accept SBUX branded Gold Cards, which is a big bummer.
3	An ok bookstore, so-called cafe.  I just ordered a vomit inducing bbq chicken pizza.  After one bite I gave it back...molten strange cheese, soft spongy crust, weird smell.  They just took it and said sorry.  Yeah, me too.
