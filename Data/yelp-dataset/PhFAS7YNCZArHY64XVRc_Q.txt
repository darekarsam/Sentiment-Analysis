4	Make your own six-pack out of local, independent beers! Great location: Duluth is near many BYOB restaurants. They also have wine. Prices are a little high, but location and beer selection make up for this. A much better than average stop.
4	Whenever we opt to head out to Au Pied de Cochon for dinner, the night inevitably ends at this depanneur located just a few blocks away. The selection of beer here, mostly from local independent breweries is unsurpassed and I love that I can make my own 6-pack, giving me the option of trying several unfamiliar beers at a time (short of coming home with 6 cases!).I find the prices to be reasonable with a 6 pack running between $11 and $14 (depending on the label color) though there are a few that are sold at it's ticketed price (blue labels). I pretty much only go here for beer, so I couldn't even tell you anything else about the place except maybe, watch your step, there are a lot of unexpected rises in the floor.On my last trip there, we picked out 2 of each of 6 new beers to try. A white tea beer, a coriander beer, a coffee beer (La Moustache?), Aphrodisiac (one of my faves), a pear beer and a pear cider! Yummers!
4	A great selection for the beer connoisseur. Whenever a QC microbrewery releases something difficult to find, they have it. This is the place to go when the common lager doesn't suffice anymore, for discoveries and the occasional recommendation.
