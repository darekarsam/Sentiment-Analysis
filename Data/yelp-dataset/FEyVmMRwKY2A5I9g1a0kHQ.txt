3	I live nearby so when in a pinch for something this is a great place to run to. Store is kept very clean. Employees seem to be allergic to smiling, but the job gets done.
3	I usually hate shopping at dedicated drug stores since you can get almost anything you need from them at a grocery store for cheaper. But, as is the case with most dedicated shops, there are services that make it worth the expense. In this case it is a pharmacy that has good hours, fills your prescription quickly, and will call to let you know when it is ready to pick up. I have never had to wait more than a few minutes for my meds and while they aren't always cheery the staff (at least in the pharmacy) is professional and competent. If you are looking for something less prescribed they have a decently large selection and no one looks at you funny for taking far too long to choose the right shade of lipstick. Parking is plentiful, though getting in and out of the lot can sometimes be a challenge. Still, I'll take it over the other branch in PM any day.
5	One of the benefits about taking a driving trip is that you can do things like go to CVS and just put the stuff in the trunk.  We went to this store today and bought a few items on sale.  The store was very clean - but the reason why I'm giving five stars is because the manager and the young female cashier were *incredibly* friendly.  When talking to the manager (who had a great sense of humor and he was very helpful), I discovered he's from Brooklyn and he recently transferred to Charlotte with CVS (NYC's loss and Charlotte's gain).  Also; I needed two rainchecks and the cashier was very sweet-natured.
