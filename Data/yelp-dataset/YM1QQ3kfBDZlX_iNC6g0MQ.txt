3	April herself did my nails. The price was good ... I didn't get pink n white full set though. But after a few days my nails started to pop so I went back in and she fixed them all for free so that was good.
1	The old guy cut my cuticle when he was doing my nails. They are old and rude. They old ass need to retire. He kept making jokes and laughing. Ill never go back there again. This is my first review. U shouldn't bleed when getting your toes done. Wtf.
1	April's husband did my fill and April polished my nails after her husband completed the fill. Both of them were rushing to go to church.  The polish ended up being a rough texture and very dull in appearance.  That very same day my nails began chipping.  I returned to the shop within two days and explained my concern.  April was very rude and failed to take ownership in the less than professional job.  Her response was "I didn't make the polish".  Granted, she may not have made the polish but she had it in her shop for customers to select from and they (she and her husband) did the less than professional job.  They refused to correct the poor job that they had done without charging me again.  I am not sure why they felt a person in their correct mind would pay again when they didn't do the first job right.  I asked both of them what type of God do they serve if they know that the fault is with them and their product and they still don't want to do the right thing?  April's exact response was " don't go bringing no God up in here!"  I am so disappointed with this shop on so many different levels that I will not ever return.  A 5 or 6 year old child could do the job that they are doing in that shop!!  If there was a negative rating I could give, I would rate them a negative 1.  Stay away from this shop unless you want a kindergarten job and they are very rude!!!!'
