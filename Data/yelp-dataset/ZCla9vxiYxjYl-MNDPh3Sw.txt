1	Looking for crepes? Go elsewhere. Not only is the food pretty bland, but they do not serve tap water to paying customers who are buying food and alcohol. Tsk tsk.
4	I like the quaint upstairs where the creperie is.  I have ordered both the sweet and the savoury crepes and they were lovely.  The menu's need to be updated and possibly laminated.  I never ordered tap water so I can't complain about that....although it's possible they don't have good tap water in that old building.  It's beautiful and the crepes are good.  Went there once and specifically go back there for crepes.
4	Excellent service, our waiter was very friendly. I had a strawberry banana crepe and my boyfriend had a mushroom cheese crepe, both were delicious. Cute inside upstairs. Also beer and wine available. I was not, however, impressed by the bird flying around inside, landing on the tables and such.
2	Nothing to rave about. Located on the 2nd floor on St. Paul street. Service is average.
2	This was like dining at your crazy neighbor Mr. Wilson's nuclear bomb shelter - except it's not 20 feet underground and there wasn't any toilet paper (except the piece wedged under the table) or water (bottled or from a pipe) available. If experiencing post-WW3 brunch excites you, bomb away.
2	While in Old Montreal was looking for a place to have a quick crepe. I viewed the menu while outside the resturant, and it looked good. The staff is very  young and friendly, but not professional.  I saw customers leaving after sitting as no wait staff came to table to anknowledge them.I ordered a simple ham and cheese crepe, it took about 20 minutes to arrive. It was just ok. I ordered a dessert crepe which was dulce leche with banannas. Both the carmel sauce  and the bannanas were very skimpy.I got my bill which was $26 for the 2 crepes and a pepsi. Definetly not worth the price. I wouldnt recommend this place.
