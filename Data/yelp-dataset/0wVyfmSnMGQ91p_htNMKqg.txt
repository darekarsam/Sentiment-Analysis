4	Like any other Starbucks, in and out in less than 5 minutes for a regular coffee.Friendly staff
2	I HATE YOU STARBUCKS! Well this one anyway!Ok I was giving you the benefit of the doubt, but oh no honey this time you DID ME DIRTY! So I ALWAYS order the same drink: Hazelnut iced coffee. Simple right? NOPE! The little douche cashier charges me for a hazelnut iced coffee breve... NO LITTLE HITA I DID NOT ASK FOR THAT! So I wait in the long line, 5 minutes later I look at the counter and my drink is just sitting there... wtff?! CALL MY NAME! I was standing close enough to hear everything.I got my drink and took a sip and it literally tasted like days old yucky coffee. I was super pissed, but why go back and say "Hey dbag, make this over? It tastes like shat bro!" No, you never know what they'll do to your drink. So here is my rant, I wasted money, time, and smiles on these little jerks!
2	Someone please help this location... The staff is undertrained,they are out of key items and supplies  and they cannot keep up with the demands of a busy  location. Fortunately they are nice which eases the annoyances of long waits and other issues.
