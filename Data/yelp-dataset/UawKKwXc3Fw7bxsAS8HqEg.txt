1	If you have an IPhone4, I would say steer clear of this establishment.  I had my not even two day old IPhone4 stolen in a split second.  It happened so quickly and this person that did it was a pro.  It was of course disturbing, but when I found out that another girl at the same bar on the same night had her IPhone4 stolen right out of her hand It made me question what kind of people are let into this place.  One of my friends almost had his designer sunglasses stolen right off of his head that night as well.  Fortunately he was able to question the guy and had the bouncer throw him out.  The owner, I must say was very gracious with me though.  He allowed me to look through the bar the next day just to double check that I hadn't just lost it. I will say that I won't be going back though.
1	Um....well.  My feet stuck to the floor.  Smoking is allowed.  Do I have to go on?Okay, maybe the only redeeming quality is that the DJ was decent.  Oh and the ultra cool third floor... looks like someone's attic.  That's why levelz is named levelz.  Awesome.
1	This bar is super GHETTO!!!Dont go
1	Disgusting.Dangerous.Don't go.
