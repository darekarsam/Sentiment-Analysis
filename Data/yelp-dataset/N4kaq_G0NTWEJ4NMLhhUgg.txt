4	A very chic place.Neatly done, nice selections for the summer/spring feel for dresses, blouses, and love their almost Stella and Dot like jewelries! I have to admit, I was impressed with the selection of dresses and their jewelry. The prices were fairly reasonable - $69-89 pending which dress you choose. They have my favorite candle scent carried by the makers of Capri Blue's Volcano! The workers here were very nice and attentive! Great customer service and friendly :)
1	I recently went into the store in SouthPark in Charlotte, NC and bought something for my daughter. They knew it was a gift. NOBODY mentioned to me that you could only get store credit when you returned things.When I took it back today, they told me I could only get store credit and that it said on the sales ticket that that was the return policy. I asked how many times they read the entire sales ticket when they bought things and told them I wanted my money back. They said no they could not do that. So now they have their item back AND my money. I will NEVER shop there again and simply want to be reimbursed for the gift I purchased. In other stores, I am always told the return policy.
4	Ugh... shut up and take all of my money. This store is adorable. I love the selection of dresses and accessories. You can find a lot for yourself or great gift ideas. They have a strict return policy about only getting store credit. Kind of stinks but I wouldn't return anything I've bought here. But if you buy a gift that is something to think about. Love it. I will be back for more!
