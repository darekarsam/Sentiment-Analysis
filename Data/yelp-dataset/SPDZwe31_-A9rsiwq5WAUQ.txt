5	3rd time ordering the Pacific Veggie Pizza. It was outstanding in every way all 3 times. This place has come a long way in my book.
4	Order #4 online and i wish there was a "cook well done" option. Other than that its great to do/use 2-3 times a month
4	I just recently moved to this area and so I have only ordered from this Domino's a total of three times.Consistently, my pizza is perfect, just as I ordered it, and is very hot. The service is extremely fast and friendly, too. This is much better than the service I was accustomed to from my old location in Charlotte. It's yet another reason why I am glad to be in the neighborhood!
3	I've ordered from this location a couple times. Good location and easy to get in and out.  The website makes it easy to order what you want and how you want it.The pizza is always cooked well and tastes good. As good as it could be with pizza chain pizza.I recently ordered the bbq chicken wings. They just seemed really fatty and pretty much tasteless. I'm sure it's not this stores fault - as I assume they are just a general wing sent to each location for prep. I think I'll just stick to ordering pizza.
5	Friendly delivery people .. even after they couldn't find the house.  Pizza was still hot and good :)  Wish I could type more details for the drivers to help them find the house.  Thanks again for great service in the Tega Cay SC area.
