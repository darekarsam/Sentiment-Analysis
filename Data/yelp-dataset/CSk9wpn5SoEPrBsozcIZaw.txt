4	Had a great experience at this HI Hostel on Rue St.Antoine.  Great location (located in downtown Montreal, right next to the 'Centre Bell' arena), close to the Metro and walkable to Griffintown (a smaller hip borough just south of the downtown) and St.Catherine road (as my friend would call, "the Times Square of Montreal").  For us, cost was $35/person/night, if you were to become a 'member' (I think a capped cost of $35 one-time fee) it would cost you $25/person/night.  Free Wi-Fi, we found free nearby street parking (except on Mondays and Thursdays for street cleaning) for our entire stay, full kitchen and fridges downstairs.  Mostly all dorm-room-like suites, we stayed in a 2-bunker with a small private bathroom though I did have a sneak peek into a neighbor's single-queen-size bedroom (also private bath).  Overall really pleasant stay, great young staff who were very accompanying and knowledgable about the surrounding area.  Would recommend and I would stay here again!
3	I just wanted to add that there is a Metro one block away. (Lucien L'Allier). I have not stayed at the hostel myself.
