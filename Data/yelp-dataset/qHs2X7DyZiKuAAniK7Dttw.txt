4	I prefer this location since it sometimes has a 5 minute wait.  Nice inside, somewhat helpful.  I like Verizon overall and especially now that they carry the iPhone.
5	Needed an iPhone replacement with my warranty. I was in and out in 9 minutes!!! Thank you, Sandy! Very sweet lady.
1	Visited this Verizon store today not impressed with management.
2	Why is it that no matter what time you come in it is always at least a 20 min wait? They need to hire more people.
