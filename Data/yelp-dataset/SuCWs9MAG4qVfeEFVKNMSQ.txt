5	Michael is a highly skilled massage therapist and he is a consummate professional at all times. He is extremely talented and approaches each and every session with enthusiasm and positive energy.  I found his responsiveness and his ability to work with my schedule to be exceptional.I first started coming to Michael while on business trips to Charlotte.  He would come to my hotel promptly for each session. Michael knew exactly how to relieve my sore muscles from the long plane rides.  Since relocating to Charlotte a few months ago, I've continued going to Michael for his massages.  After strenuous weightlifting workouts, a massage from Michael is perfect for muscle recovery.  His work for me in deep tissue full-body massage was second-to-none.  I feel great after my massage every time.  Thanks to Michael, I can keep up my 6 day a week workout schedule.Michael is quick to identify trouble spots and provides relief.  I am completely satisfied after every session.
5	As one of Michael's first clients (4+ yrs),  I can attest to his professional and friendly approach. My wife and I get treatments on a regular basis. His knowledge and skills You are missing out if you do not choose Michael.
5	Michael was amazing and the best massage I've ever had! He scheduled me at the last minute when I was in a lot of back pain. He was professional, prompt and practiced techniques that were just what I needed to get my back on its way to healing. I will definitely recommend him to all of my friends and family. Thank you, Michael!
5	Professional and able to accommodate my schedule. There are a ton of masseurs in Charlotte, but few are as nice, professional, and generous as Mike with Infini Massage and Body Works!
