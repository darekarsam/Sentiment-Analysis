4	Usually one of the cheapest priced gas stations in the Vegas area south of the strip.  The cash price is even a few cents less! =)  Excellent value for a 76 gas station.
2	store is always in some sort of disarray but I overlook since it has the cheapest gas besides Circle K down the street.
4	Usually my last stop going home if I drive to Vegas.  Cheapest gas in the area
1	I guess since they have the cheapest cash price for gas here in Las Vegas, you don't need to have a nice personality. The guys here are just plain dicks, one of them smelled of alcohol too.
1	This place sucks there's 3 different prices? Car wash 10 cents cheaper cat wash with a bag of ice 20 cents cheaper.  So tiny of a car wash in the back.
5	Left my wallet on the gas pump, called and got the owner ASAP.  He gave me the number to the station. I called and they went and grabbed my wallet and waited for me. Staff was kind and helpful.    Thanks again guys
1	Rip off 2.79 with car wash otherwise 3.09 what a rip.Gas down the street is only 2.79 without the car wash , ice.   Drive further it's worth it.
