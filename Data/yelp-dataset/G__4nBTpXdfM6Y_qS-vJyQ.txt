5	Bargain Shopper Heaven. I went in here and had a ball, i'm sure hubby didn't like that bill. lolol. I got 2 pairs of shoes, clothes, baby gear and some home decor. I saw so many things I want to go back and get for Christmas gifts. They have something for everyone in the family and I still need to get gifts for my mom and sister so I shall return. I've even gotten dog stuff out of here. I love a good bargain!Warning: DO NOT GO IN HERE IF YOU ARE IN RETAIL THERAPY.
3	This store has been hit or miss for me.  Sometimes I find great deals on clothing and home decor items....but other times, not so much.  I don't typically go out of my way to shop here, but from time to time I will stop in when I am in the neighborhood.My last great find here was a pair of nice lawn chairs for poolside that were on sale at the end of the summer season.
2	I feel like discount or bargain stores like Burlington Coat Factory are a hit or miss. Sometimes you luck out with incredible stuff and other times, you miss out.  I've never lucked out here.I give most stores that I see potential the rule of 5's... You miss a truck of new goodies, you're between seasons, etc. BCF, well, let's just say I've walked in 5 times and never bought anything... Not once.I think the big reason I've come away with nothing is the store set-up.  it's so crammed and so messy.  Bad store planning for the lay-out and inconsiderate shoppers who make a disgusting mess.  I did give an extra star for the staff. They've always been friendly and helpful, which always means a lot to me.I'd rather go anywhere else but BCF - Check the sale racks at Belk or head to Ross before you consider here.
