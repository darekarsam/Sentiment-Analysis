5	I'm working with Laura at Physiotherapy Associates, and the experience has been amazing. I came in barely able to do any sort of moving, but after 3 weeks, I have most of my range of motion back, and am able to do things that I like doing pain free! Physical Therapy as a whole is not a fun experience, but I look forward to my appointments every week because of the knowledgeable staff, and their great attitudes.
5	I had shoulder surgery and physical therapy has been great here at this site.  my recovery has been easy to handle and the personnel are great.  Trevor has been the best therapist there.  My range of motion is back after two months.
5	Having more medical issues then I care to mention here & tell you what to do then ignore you experiences with previous PT, Trevor Stutz & his team are knowlagable, attentive & best of all listen to you as you listen to your body and adjust the session accordingly with a wide range of treatment options resulting in feeling better then I did when I walked in the door, with being unable to take traditional pain medication is nothing short of AMAZING.
