4	The truck was parked outside of Noda Brewing when I was there one day and my husband and I ordered their soft shell crab po boy with fries as the side. The sandwich was delicious with homemade sauce on top, simple but good. Their fries are tossed with old bay seasoning which is an excellent complement to the other food options.
4	I don't know if it was the beer from NoDa Brewing (where they were parked) but this place was great.  The location was spot on (parked outside a brewery!) and the food was tasty.  I had the Soft Shell Crab Po Boy and it definitely hit the spot.  The crab was lightly breaded and fried to perfection, served on a soft bun with a tangy and delicious roulade.  The fries were crispy and well seasoned with Old Bay.  Whether it's after drinks for just for lunch, I recommend MC&C for sure.
1	I wanted to try their menu for the first time at the Cabarrus County Food Truck Friday.   The event was held from 5-9pm.  I didn't get there until shortly after 8, waited in line for over an hour.  Because the line was so long they were still serving customers after 9, there were still a good 25-30 people still in line.  I am finally the second customer from the window, it's 9:15p, and they tell us they're done!  And not politely either.  She just shouted to everyone "WE'RE DONE!" There were only maybe 10-12 people left in line!  So I didn't get to try anything!   I will never attempt to get anything from here again.  Lost my business before I've even tried it.
1	The Crabcake sandwich was a disappointment. The Cake was bland and served with two plain pieces of white bread with nothing on it. Hardly considered a sandwich.
5	This place is AWESOME!!!! Cheap, fresh, and simple. Highly recommend. Try the crab cakes duh. Be careful though I drop mine on the ground because my friend said "WHOA there's undrank beers over there!!!!" super loud causing me to knock this delicious food over.
