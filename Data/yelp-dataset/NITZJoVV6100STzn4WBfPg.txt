5	Ended up seeing Dr. Diekman for about 6 months after 2 consecutive accidents being rear ended. They are always super flexible on scheduling and if I needed to reschedule it was never an issue. Dr Diekman is really good and patient. Very knowledgeable and I feel better than I did before the accidents. I used to have general lower back pains and now I don't. Very highly recommended. They also have lots of candy which is great too!
5	I would like to thank Dr. Deikman for his help. I am a Chiropractor that practices in the area and I see Dr. Deikman for spinal adjustments. He is knowledgeable, professional and a great adjuster. Take it from me, as a chiropractor, you can't go wrong with Dr. Deikman.
