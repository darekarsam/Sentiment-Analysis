5	Ahh I would walk over hot coals to eat here! They have a new item everyday. Also some mainstay items like the veggie burger that's to die for. There's even a little garden that you can walk through to see some of the produce that they use. So inexpensive as well. You can take advantage of the frequent buyer card. 6 punches and your meal is free! I've sampled a lot of items here like the bleu cheese pizza, fresh baked brownies, couscous and an Asian salad that I have tried to replicate but cannot for the life of me get the spices right. I ride a bike so it's a little out of the way for me but I have been known to take hour lunches just to take advantage of their savory meals. Everyone there is so friendly too and I have never had a bad experience. And right next to this cafe is a yummy coffee bar where they serve Italian soda. I don't know how a place like this exists but I am so glad I have had a chance to experience it. Thanks to Bonnie G. for pushing me in the right direction!P.S. Try their iced tea located next to the soda fountain. You will thank me later..
5	I work nearby so I eat here a few times every week and love the featured items that are different every day. They also have a preferred dining card which gets you a free meal every 7th visit. Excellent lunch food, options, and it's cheap for what you are getting.
2	There are many better places than this for anything. Poor hours not very good don't eat here unless you have to even than maybe just wait
