3	I am totally torn with this place. I love the idea. I mean who can't an american ice cream dinner. Give me some stars and stripes and then I am totally on board! But in all serious-ness. I want to love it. But it might take a couple more visits. The interior is exactly what i wanted and expected. Big booths. Tiled floors. They also have ipads floating about for you to play with. It's great! So they have a massive ice cream counter, pick any flavour, they make you a lovely thick milkshake with it. I played it safe and went with strawberry and it was lovely. They also do sundaes, coffees, pick n mix....... and coke floats!! Yes. COKE FLOATS!!! I know where I am headed when I am having one of those childish days!! So I didn't go up and order, but apparently service was meh. Oh, and be prepared for lots of screaming kids who have had too much sugar. Seriously.... when will people learn?!
5	This place is great!! Absolute sugar paradise. Love the fact you can get your favourite choc mashed up into a milkshake. Cool place to hang around in. They have massive TVs, ipads......
3	50's style diner serving ice cream and milkshakes. Lots of ice cream and toppings available but just didn't wow me like Affogato. Open later than Affogato at the weekend, hence ended up here on a Sunday evening.I suspect there is more artificial stuff in the ice cream here than in some of the other places popping up in Edinburgh. It appears bought in and as for asking about special dietary requirements - good luck. The brunette server (I think was really embarrased by her blonde colleague after I asked the blonde about this), did make the effort to try and check the tubs of what I was asking about. The two ice creams I had were nice, but just nice and a week on, I am struggling to remember what I had. It was ok, but I can't actually see myself going back here. Great concept, service meh.
