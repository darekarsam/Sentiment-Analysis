1	Terrible!! UWCREDIT UNION is terrible for customer service! I will never bank with them again! Their practices are what give banks all over a bad rep.-YOU GUYS SUCK!
5	UWCU is a phenomenal financial institution. In all my dealings they have always been straight-forward and honest.  Tellers are always friendly and helpful and their financial advisers are great at sitting down and distilling complex financial topics in a no-nonsense manner.  We have worked with Matt Deadman in the past and have been continually impressed.
