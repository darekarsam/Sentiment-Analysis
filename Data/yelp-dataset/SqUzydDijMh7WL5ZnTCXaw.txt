5	This place is awesome, they've got every dimension of steel you can think of in stock.  I came in looking for some scraps for a small project.  They had just what I needed in the scrap area, they'll cut it to length and the best part, it's only $0.50/lb!  What a deal!I wound up talking with 5 different guys while I was there and each of them were friendly and helpful.
2	Had an exchange nightmare! Ordered aluminum and they delivered steel. Ok, no big deal, just exchange it. WRONG! 7 calls over a week and I still dont have the right product. I had the boss in sales tell me it was "on the truck" two days in a row only to have the original order still sitting on my dock. After waiting 2 weeks I have picked up what I needed and cancelled payment on the original order. Who knows if they'll ever come to get their steel back....
2	Good location but they don't have much competition in the Vegas Valley so I think the prices are pumped up a bit more than if they had a major competitor. This lack of competition also makes them not care about marketing. Every time I call for pricing and availability the people give you a feeling you are bothering them if you aren't a big player and building a casino. No reflection on the yard guys,,,,, they are helpful and friendly....also the effect shows in lack of a web site with prices and inventory that would eliminate me bothering the counter help and let me estimate my own jobs.....but they are the big player in town and I'm just a little guy....I would give them a 5 star review  if they would get a web site with prices and material. I don't care if the counter guys were cranky, I'm not looking for drinkin' buddies..
