4	HH is the kind of place you go to when you're low on cash, it's Monday night & you are willing to drive to pick up your food.  They used to offer a medium 1-topping pizza for $5.55 on Monday nights.  Last wk when I called to order the special, they said it changed to a large for $5.99.  The beauty of this offer is that you don't have to buy 3 pizzas to get that price like the other chains!!!!!  With the economy in the toilet, I was astounded that they increased the size thereby improving the value for my hard earned dollars.  As for taste & quality--it's pretty good.  I like to order the thin crust and usually get sausage or pepperoni anything extra, I add on myself (e.g., red onion, black olives, etc).  They don't glop on the sauce or skimp on the cheese & I've never rec'd a burnt/nearly burnt pizza.  It's even pretty good reheated.
4	Pizza is pretty good and reasonably priced.  Crusts with different flavors a nice touch.  Sesame  seed dough very tasty.   Meat eater topping also good.
