4	This restaurant plum in the park opens up onto the skating rink below. It's run as a co-op so is involved with all kinds of great causes like the Food Secure Canada Feast of Ideas. Currently under construction and therefore a little chaotic, and maybe a little cold and cafeteriay in the decor, I still think this would be a dream space to do all kinds of events.
