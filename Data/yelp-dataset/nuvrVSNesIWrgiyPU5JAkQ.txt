4	It's a divey little bar in a sketchy part of town and for what I this better than most.Karaoke Wednesdays$1,50 beers during NFL
4	I always judge bar food on the chicken wings. This spot has probably the best wings I've ever had! They fry rather than bake (baked wings are usually slimy & gross) and the ones I ordered today were super crispy on the outside and juicy without being gooey on the inside.  They were so good I didn't even need dipping sauce, although I tried the habanero wing sauce which was tasty with plenty of kick.  Hubby got the Mexican burger for a second time & he described it as phenomenal.  They also make their own tortilla chips and salsa and have a salsa bar in the restaurant area.  Day shift bartender was great, attentive but not pushy or clingy. Sadly it was pretty quiet. They've only been open a few months so hopefully they get a good sized following & keep their doors open!
5	There was a bar attached?  I went for the street tacos in the restaurant. Tried pastor, Barbacoa, and carnitas tacos to see which one I liked more. Next time I go I'll order the same thing because they were all amazing.
