4	I was so sad when Doug's Market and Buena Vista Coffee Shop both closed this year! Luckily the Allegheny City Market showed up. Their sandwiches are tasty, and it's great to be able to just grab some hummus or veggies. Plus I'm glad they carry bread from Allegro Hearth!
5	Grocery store options? On the Northisde? Unfortunately the only option is an often crowded Giant Eagle that leans on the side of sketchy. Fortunately Allegheny City Market opened, and I couldn't be happier. it's the perfect place to run to when you just need a couple things, but their selection is expansive enough that if you wanted you could do all of your shopping here. They have a full service deli that sells Boar's Head meats, a small produce cooler that has peppers, onions, lettuce, lemons and limes, fresh coffee by the pound from La Prima, fresh Breadworks bread, pastas, rice, seasoning, etc. Every employee that I have met has been nothing but nice. It's a great addition to the neighborhood.
5	This market is such an asset to the neighborhood. The prices are comparable enough to Giant Eagle that we do our best to do a lot of weekly shopping here whenever possible. They have a good variety of fresh produce they and wow, don't skip out on Leona's Ice Cream Sandwiches if they have them in stock. The deli counter is impressive with some of the best sandwiches in the Northside. The employees are friendly and I really appreciate that they're open to requests and suggestions.  Every neighborhood should be so lucky!
5	The Market is a great (not so new anymore) addition to the neighborhood. Great place to pick up a sandwich, some treats, and groceries. Staff is always friendly and helpful, and they like dogs, too! You can't get everything at ACM, but you can get a majority of the essentials, some produce, and lots of local goods. If you need something and they don't have it, they will get it for you for your next trip. Highly recommend stopping by!
