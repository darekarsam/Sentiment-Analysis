1	The former papa johns closed and reopened in the same shopping center.  It is terrible pizza. I don't blame the staff or delivery folks.  Wonderful.  But since we have virtually no pizza delivery in Cave Creek, papa johns is pretty much it.  So my winter visitors order papa johns and the consensus is always that it sucks. They are just baking pre made pizza.  I see the refrigerator trucks unloading there   This isn't a hit on this franchise. I hated it everywhere I've lived.  I feel like a heroin addict ordering Papa Johns.  I need the drug (pizza) but I know I'm killing myself with this dope
