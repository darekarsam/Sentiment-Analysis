2	Moved in to Borgata condominiums on July 2013, nice place well kept and quiet. Well the quiet part is a little exaggeration due to the (FIRE RISER ROOM) coming on every 3-4 hours for about 20-30 minutes, yes even at night when you are trying to sleep. Well when I first signed my contract they had really nice management at the front office, now I am not sure if they have changed management company but the new people at the office are really rude and very ignorant. Back to the fire riser room, I called the office the first few days about the really annoying noise, at the time they meaning the people at the office claimed to have no knowledge about the noise, sent a maintenance employee out even he claimed he did not know what it was, yeah right!!! long story short they said it would be fixed. This problem still persists up until now it is December just came back from the office, lady at the office says she does not know what a fire riser room is, ARE YOU STUPID OR SOMETHING LADY, you live here. Well apart from all of that I like the convenience of being close to shopping dining and entertainment in las vegas. If I had to change anything about this place it would be the management, or maybe retraining for them would help a little, but you cannot help ignorant people.
1	I have lived here twice, from 2001 to 2004, and 2010 to the present 2014.The location is fantastic but living here is not.There are constant problems that never seem to get solved. The worst by far is the constant incidents of the fire alarms going off for no reason.They have malfunctioned at least half a dozen times at random for all of the years I have lived here.  This April or 2014 they went off three times in five days.  The first incident happened at 7am and lasted almost four hours.  The alarms are so piercing that you must vacate the apartments and hide in your car.Three days later it happened again at 2am and lasted until 7am, I lost a nights sleep and had to call in sick to work.  When gathering outside with all of my incensed neighbors they told me to disconnect the alarms so I could at least re enter my apartment. Management was totally unhelpful and gave us false information about the alarm company.  There response was always one of annoyance and non blame for these incidents.Unbelievably, it  happened again two mornings later, but I must admit it was resolved after one hour.  The other incredibly annoying malfunction is the air conditioner and the heating.They are constantly not working properly, I have asked so many times to have my thermostat changed, but they always, always blame the air filters.As I am writing this my air conditioning is blowing warm air and it is over 100 degrees outside.I have finally decided to move even though it is not time for me to buy a place.  I am forced to move out because of these unresolved issues.
1	I have lived here for a year the management is incapable of fixing the smallest issues. The level of renter has gone down hill. If you want gang members, strippers and gypsies this is the place. Security when ever you have a issue will inform you to cal the police they are just there to observe and report?!
1	My review is based off of a single phone call. I called to get pricing on a 3 bedroom and the woman on the phone was BEYOND rude in the 5 seconds I had her on the phone. She told me the price after a long sigh (Probably because I called 10 minutes before the office closed, so what?), I said thank you, and was about to ask another question, but I got hung up on. I would have liked to view the apartments, but because of that one phone call alone I will look elsewhere. First impressions last a lifetime..
2	Maybe it was a good thing that my boyfriend and I got denied a place here. We went there a month ago to check the condos out with our children. Ann was the agent showing us around. She kept blowing my phone up for days to get us to fill out an app. I wanted to wait to see if I can get better. We finally decided to do it and two times that I told her I was 10 minutes away, her "I'll be back sign was up." If I told you I was on my way then why don't you let me know that you'll be heading out of the office? Mind you, everytime I call to get inside the gate, there's no answer. Thankfully, people come in and out that place. I had to go back two more times because she forgot to had me sign other papers. That place is so unorganized. Then I get a call saying that I was denied.. Ann kept telling me multiple times that I should call my boyfriend and find out why I was denied... Like, hello!?!?! I am an applicant as well. You should let me know! I ask to speak to her manager and she says that her manager is in a conference meeting, yet I receive a call from Robin one second later. I found out later that my boyfriend was denied because of a charge from 2001. He's a manager who brings two times your highest rent & that's not including my income. You have people who are out of the country & have other people living in their house for them (a guy came in the office & said that), yet deny someone who had a past charge from almost 15 years ago? Overall, the apartments were nice... Could use a better office system & staff, this experience just made us go for a house next.
1	*** MUST READ *** **** MUST READ ***I honestly WISH I would have read the reviews before I went to try and get an apartment at Borgata. Worst experience of my life! I just wanna start off by saying FUCK ANNE AND ROBIN. Excuse the language but I am enraged. It all started when I got a call from Anne (leasing agent) sometime late August, she told me the apt I toured a few weeks earlier was going for a lower price and to come put a hold on it if I was still interested. I ended up going the next day because I was desperate for an apartment and put $270 down to hold it. Me and my girlfriend filled out some paper work that same day and like the review below me says, she will blow your phone up!! The old hag is annoying! Every little thing she would call, most of the time she called because of some papers she forgot to have us sign. I swear we came up to the office 3-4 different times because of their mistakes and it got to the point I just let the calls go to voicemail. She was verrrrrry unprofessional and sooooooo inconsiderate knowing I had to go to work. So a few days go by and they already start giving us a hard time, long story short it took weeks for us to get them to do a job verification because of some issues they were having with my gfs job. At one point we almost backed out because of all the shit we were going through and my gf straight up told Robin (manager) to cancel her application. A few days later I called and told her NEVERMIND that we are still going through with it! After that they tell me everything is going good and they were gonna finallllllly run our credit! A week goes by and here we were waiting for a phone call to find out if we got approved on the credit check, but I never got one so I called asking Anne if we got approved or not and when would be a good time to come sign the lease, she responded by saying she didn't know, all the paper work and information was in Robins office and she was gone for the day. Sooo another few days go by and I ended up calling this morning and spoke with Robin and guess what I found out ?! I got approved and my gf got denied. I just wanna know WHEN WERE YOU PLANNING ON TELLING US ROBIN!? She basically told us not to worry that she was gonna have a phone meeting with her boss and she would let us know if we would still be able to move in. She called me later that day and said we would be all good to move in Saturday but the grand total we had to pay was around $1,100 ARE YOU CRAZY? She said it was $300 extra because she didn't get approved! No way way in hellllllll we were gonna pay that much to move into some apartments, specially not one that had such a horrible staff. I called right back after she gave me the news and told her we are definitely not moving in. I asked about getting the $270 deposit back and as soon as I heard "no" we aren't able to get that back I instantly hung up on the bitch. Both Anne and Robin need to be fired if you ask me. They wasted so much of our time and money and at the end of it all we have less than a week to find a new apartment!!! Honestly I just don't want anybody to go through what we went through so I took the time to write this long review! Thank you if you took the time to read it all.. Hopefully it keeps many people AWAY from this place.
5	My husband and I just moved in 3 days ago... I was surprised to read the angry reviews before we decided to look at the condo's!!- I know there are always 2 sides to every story so we went to check it out for ourselves... We went in without an appointment and was shown a vacant 2 bedroom condo.  We were happy because we got to actually see the condo we wanted to apply for.  We were told that the application fee was $35 per person over 18 that would be living in the condo.  We were told there would be a non-refundable admin.fee of $100 and a $100 holding deposit to hold the condo.  The $100 holding deposit would go toward our total security deposit of $400 upon approved credit.  They gave us an application packet with the move in requirements and list of fee's attached to the application.  We went to view a few other places to compare prices and amenities...  After viewing 5 other communities in the area and within our price range we decided the Borgata Condo's was the best by far.  These condo's have modern stainless steel appliances and granite countertops. Washer and dryers are in the condo and each room has a ceiling fan- that was a big plus for us.  The grounds are clean and nice- we never seen so much grass in a community in Las Vegas- most other communities has a lot of rocks in the landscaping.  We like that it was gated and has roaming security 24 hours.  Fee's were the lowest among the other communities we viewed- the other communities had a higher admin fee and security deposit requirement.  while we did not qualify for the lowest security deposit because of our credit rating and we were willing to pay the $400 plus a full months rent as a deposit... all of the other places wanted more for a security deposit.  We knew it was going to cost us a little more because of our credit rating anywhere we went for apply.The application process went smoothly - we were able to get the requirements to our agent quickly we were not asked for anything outrageous- they needed to verify our income, our rental history, our employment history and the application was only one page long.  Everyone in the office was nice, courteous and knowledgeable.   We never saw or spoke to this Ann person referred to in the other reviews-I don't think she works there anymore.    On move in day, our keys were ready, our lease was ready for us to sign and we did a walk through of our new condo and everything was great.  There were one or two items that we needed to ask to have looked at but very minor.  The maintenance guys came right away to fix them and everything has been perfect since then.   We give our thumbs up and would recommend the Borgata as a great place to live!
