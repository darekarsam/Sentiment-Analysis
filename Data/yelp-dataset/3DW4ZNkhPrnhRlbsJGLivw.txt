5	I see my doctor at the Scottsdale office but get shots here so this pertains only to the allergy shot lab.  The ladies are friendly and efficient.  No complaints at all.
5	Although I generally see Dr. Erdos at the Scottsdale location, I get my allergy shots at this location.  Occasionally, when I don't feel like schlepping to two different offices, I'll see a doctor at this location.  I saw Dr. Ching last week and she was fantastic.  Extremely knowledgeable, thorough, and recognized a recommendation from my ENT was in my file and addressed it with me because it's a specialty of hers.  Much like Dr. Erdos, she provided an excellent level of care and I would not hesitate to see her again.
5	They have been great with my daughter! We see MD Jorgensen and they are very professional and courteous here.
1	The worst allergy place around. Very unprofessional staff as they lack tact, finesse and have poor communication skills with patients like myself. After a year and a half, I was informed that I was being discharged from this outfit for unknown reasons with no prior warnings at all and the doctor never even gave me a phone call! They have a lot of nerve and frankly I don't need them. Avoid at all costs and seek allergy treatments elsewhere. Not recommended ever!!!!!!
4	This place is good but there is a long wait to see an allergist - I typically had to wait 30-60 minutes past my appointment time so plan ahead. Otherwise, everyone was nice and helped me to determine what I was allergic to :)
