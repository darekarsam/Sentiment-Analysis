5	Great service, fun owner with original jokes.  Clean place and his hair.
4	David and the crew are awesome. Only place I get my hair cut.
5	David has been cutting my hair for the longest time. The guy knows what he is doing, the best barber I have been to in the valley by far. I drive 30 minutes for the fade. All the barbers here and the Stylist Sivan are great at what they do, plus the shop is nice which makes it relaxing when you go there.  Thanks guys keep it up.
