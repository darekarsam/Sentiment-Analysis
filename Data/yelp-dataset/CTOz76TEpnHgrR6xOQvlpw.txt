5	If you are looking for a personal trainer, you must check out The Body Shop. Michael is a great guy and great at motivating you to reach the results you are looking for!The one on one training can't be beat! He is the sole owner, so you have his full attention! His rates are great too!
5	Michale is the best personal trainer I've had by far. He really pushes you to help teach your goals and helps you succeed in what you want. My endurance, balance and well being is better due the techniques he shows me. My energy level is higher and my attitude towards health has changed. I couldn't have done this without the motivation Michael gives me. If you need a well trained professional at a great price, you definitely need to contact the BodyShop.
5	I feel so lucky to have found Michael as my personal trainer! I am doing strength training with him and he uses a lot of Calisthenics. Don't be fooled by the lack of machines, you definitely work up a sweat and get sore muscles! He never pushes you beyond your limits but will definitely make you pump out a few extra reps if he feels your body can handle it. Michael is a super knowledgeable and chill guy. He tailors the workouts to each client and puts a lot of variety in each session so your body doesn't get used to doing the same type of exercises. If you're looking to skip the mainstream gym trainers and save a bundle of money, give Michael a call!
