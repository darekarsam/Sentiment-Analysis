5	Looked everywhere for a place that would repair my Samsung Galaxy S4 cracked glass screen for a reasonable price. Seriously the best price in Vegas, it was worth the drive for me.The owner is super nice and honest, great costumer service. He was even willing to open earlier and close later to convenience a customer. Would recommend to everyone!
5	Fast friendly and honest service. We brought our iPad here 3 different times. They saved us so much money. You won't find a better deal anywhere else to replace iPad screen. I would recommend this place to anyone.
5	Dropped my Samsung Tablet and wouldn't open up. Laptop Services had it fixed in just over an hour, and for a really nominal rate. I recommend them highly.
