1	Every time I go into this store it's the same two woman there offering up there POOR service. One woman usually walks around and sweeps the floor around you angrily and the other slaps the sandwich together. I spoke with the businesses around this store and they all stated how rude they were. This could possibly be daughters of the owner because there is no way these two would get a job anywhere else. I actually drive 2 miles south to the other subway just to avoid the bad service. STAY AWAY!!!Store # 404546475 N Decatur Blvd#110 Shadow Mountain ShoppingLas Vegas, NV 89130, USA702-395-6237
5	Great store, nice people.
3	This particular location is good, but not spectacular.  I go when I'm in the mood for a sub.  The ingredients appear fresh.  The store is clean and the staff is competent.  I've been at this location on a few occasions at lunch.
