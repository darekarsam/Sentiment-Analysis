4	Trop cool pour moi.Clebard was a pretty fun joint. The DJ that was there Saturday night was playing a great mix of old school hip hop, top 40, reggae... basically anything with a beat.The crowd is chill, and has no qualms about joyous white person dancing. People were super friendly, drinking and singing along with us and such. They also have a crazy shot special. It's something like 6 shots of Bourbon for 20 bucks. In American dollars that's only $18.50! Too bad we had places to be the next morning.Anyway, if you're in this part of Montreal and are looking for a good place to drink and dance, Clebard's got your number.
