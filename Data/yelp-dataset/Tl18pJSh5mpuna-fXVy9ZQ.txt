1	Stopped in for a pedi after work, was lured by their 50% off banner. Got say the worst pedi I've ever gotten! The water was cold, the lady didn't massage my feet. I guess you can say she applied lotion at the very least. Although I had to rub it in, and to add to it my polish chipped in just 4 days!
5	4 of us got pedi and mani done. Great service.  Place is very clean and everyone is friendly. Price is fair. Jimmy is our favorite.  He was funny and helpful.  He even refer us to a great hair dresser!
3	Never noticed this place before but had some time to kill so tried them out. Only one customer and looks like they just opened because it was a little messy inside. Anyway told the guy I wanted gel manicure with a snowflake design, he asked to see the picture and said yes he could do it.  And he did a GREAT job. Took his time and used his artistry to make it beautiful. Wish he had more people person customer service skills (was a little abrupt) but at the end of the day the product is what matter.
