4	I'm an occasional cigar smoker and a friend took me here to buy a few cigars for the evening. The owner (?) couldn't have been more helpful, even to the point of suggesting the type of cut to make in our cigars based on their size. Next time I'm here, I'll be back.
5	Never been here...but I bought a gift card over the phone. SUPER friendly and SUPER helpful! Nice to find such a friendly business:)
5	Mojito is a fantastic store, with a friendly staff and a really great active membership.  Bill is a great proprietor and has a staff that is friendly and knowledgable. I wish they had longer hours on weeknights, even an hour longer to 8 pm would be helpful for a full time worker like me that can't get over there by 7 pm usually.  But, great selection of cigars and always bringing in new stuff.
