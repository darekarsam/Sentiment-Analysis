1	I brought my lawnmower here after it up and died on me after only one season of use.  Since it is still so new it is under the manufacturer's warranty, so the manufacturer (Briggs & Straton) told me that this was the nearest company to my house that does repairs under their warranty.  The people working there seemed annoyed that I was even there, especially when I mentioned that it should still be under warranty.  One gentleman took a quick look at it, showed me a couple of points of maintenance I should consider for it's upkeep, offered some thinly veiled belittlement for not knowing how to properly maintain a lawn mower, and said it would be over a week before they could have it ready.  I don't know much about lawnmowers or how to repair them, but this shouldn't be a hard fix for them, certainly nothing that should take over a week.  The whole experience was completely awkward.  Their customer service was abysmal, and they showed no interest in repairing my lawnmower in a timely fashion.  I will not be returning for any reason, even though it is so close to where I live.
4	We have purchased several pieces of equipment from Tempe Power Equipment including backpack blowers, hedge trimmers, and saws, and  have found them to be very helpful in selecting the right equipment for the job. Some of their recommendations actually saved me quite a bit of money as well. I have also used their service department for repairs on several occasions. The price was reasonable and they have always met my expectations. They have a good selection of parts or can order in whatever is needed.
5	The guys are very helpful and I have been going here for years for professional service. Great equipment selection and servicing ability
