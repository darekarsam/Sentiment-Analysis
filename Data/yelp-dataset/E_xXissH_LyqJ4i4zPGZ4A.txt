5	WONDERFUL. If you are visiting Montreal and want something right outside of the BUSY city, this is your place. GREAT prices, handicapped accessible (which was critical for my grandmother) and friendly beyond belief. This town has shopping, a Target, and great restaurants ( I suggest Mrs.Amigos, it is not what it seems) Comfortable, affordable, bilingual, clean. We stayed two nights. The only odd thing was a man staying downstairs who seemed to stare into our room every time he would step out for a smoke, FREAKED US OUT, but that wasn't this wonderful hotel's fault. The breakfast? MAGNIFICENT and the staff works very hard to keep everything stocked and clean. It will impress you, I suggest tipping them!
