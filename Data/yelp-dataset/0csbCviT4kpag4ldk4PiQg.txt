1	I had an appointment for them to come out on a Monday between 3-5pm. After waiting around all afternoon 5:30pm rolled around and they had neither shown up nor contacted me. It took me twenty minutes to get a hold of someone to find out that one of their technicians called in sick and that they couldn't get to my house--thanks for the phone call! I (like an idiot) rescheduled for the same week on a Wednesday between 3-5pm and THE SAME THING HAPPENED. I finally got ahold of them at 4:45pm and asked where the technician was and they said he'd be there around 5:30! Terrible customer service, I wasted two afternoons this week sitting around waiting for someone who would never show up. Do not hire these guys.
1	dont waste your time!!!!! we tried to use this company 8 years ago 3 no call no shows from their techs !! flash forward to our new house my husbands calls to set up again (against my advice) they no call no show again!!!!! i call local office they cant reach the tech ...shocker!!! plenty of pest control in the valley !! they must not need the business !!
5	Since the only other review on here was about service from 8 years ago, I thought that I would add my two cents.This company is fantastic. I just moved to Phoenix from South Carolina and my wife is scared to death about scorpions. This company has been a pleasure to deal with and so far no scorpions.
