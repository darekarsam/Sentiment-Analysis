4	Moved to better location! A MUCH better location. Previously one had to fight with the I376 interchange to get into or out of this FedEx. Then it was hell getting out. Now they are several doors to the south at the stop light. MUCH easier to get into.
1	I am here in the middle of a weekday. They are busy and only ONE employee is working both print and shipping, plus she keeps having to stop working the customer line to answer phone calls.
5	I visited the Greentree Location on several different occasions this week and received great service from all the employees who dealt with me (Mark, Jason & Terry). They were very knowledgeable and efficient and I was especially impressed by Terry who just has such a warm and friendly personality. I mentioned to him that I had seen several reviews on their site (http://local.fedex.com/pa/pittsburgh/office-0525/) some of which had mentioned him by name and they had even suggested he be promoted and given a raise. He appeared genuinely shocked by this and responded that he just comes to work and does his job and is happy to hear that people have responded positively to him. I thanked him for his great service and look forward to using this Fedex/Kinko's location in the future.
