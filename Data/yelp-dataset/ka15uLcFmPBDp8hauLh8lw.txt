5	Well, this Gail also likes PhXpress because it is so darn convenient. It is located directly across from all the Southwest Airlines gates in the Phoenix airport. So as long as you can get yourself to these gates, it is very easy to walk over and load up on books, magazines, newspapers and snacks. I remember that I bought a delicious fruit water beverage last week that had no fake sugar and was naturally sweetened. It was so refreshing, especially in the sizzling summer heat of Arizona.  The employees seem to be on the ball and move the lines along quickly so you are not just standing there waiting. The magazines were current too. I offer 5 YELP STARS for outstanding location and the fact that this is NOT another Hudson News!
4	PhXpress is a particularly convenient store located inside the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. I stopped on the way to my flight to pick up gum and a water. Got in and out in two minutes without complete financial rape. If you are needing soft drinks, use the vending machine and save yourself some coin. PhXpress. CANYOU DIG IT.
2	I was just at the store across from Gate C3 at Sky Harbor Terminal 4. I have chronic pain and prefer cold water to take my medication.  While trying to find a cold water bottle, I attempted to ask Employee Christina (who had been loudly complaining how tired she was to the entire store) how the bottles were loaded into the cooler because they all felt room temp. Before I could finish my question, she basically barked that they were all room temp.  Fortunately, her coworker was very kind and explained that the first shelf would be cooler.I am sending this review to the company as well. Hopefully, they will reprimand Christina, compliment her coworker (unfortunately I do not know her name) and implement a process so that the water is replenished regularly to ensure at least some cold water.
