4	ultimate dive bar
3	Hmmm...what to say about Key West.  I wouldn't exactly call it "warm" - get it - hahaha.  A friend and I checked this place out on a Friday night.  You know that point in the night when you think to yourself, "I could go home right now and call it a night or I could do this right and see where the night leads me".  Well we decided on the latter and it led us to Key West.It is a total dive of a bar.  It's fairly small inside and no one seemed to pay us any attention.  Key West seems like the type of bar where you get regulars and so if you've never been there before, you're probably going to stick out.  But no one really bothered us and we just hung out for a bit.  There seemed to be a potential fight breaking out behind us and like I said it's not that big so it caused a bit of a scene in the bar.  It quickly died down and started back up and then tapered back down - fyi this seems like a normal occurrence as my friend and I were the only ones that were alarmed.    Another thing to keep in mind beside the potential fights is that its cash only.
3	Total Dive.  Umm.  A gang fight started breaking out and one of the guys had tear drops tatted on his face.  Isn't that code for murder?  The bartender shouted to break the fight up not exactly in those words but yahhh.  We left soon after.  Enter here at your own risk...although I will say I may have stuck out like a sore thumb here but no one bugged.  I have a feeling I'll never go back.  Makes for a good story- 3 stars for that...
