5	Cafe Vivo is my favourite in Edinburgh! They have a range of things to eat, from soup of the day (which is delicious) to wraps and fish and chips! I think I've tried everything on their menu and I have to say their food is made very very well! This is the perfect cafe to sit and have a cup of tea with a piece of cake while you people watch (they have free Wi-Fi by the way) or sit and have some lunch with a friend, family or your partner. The atmosphere is very nice inside and the staff are so friendly. I love going in, sitting by the window having a hot cup of Nutella hot chocolate with a ham, cheese and tomato wrap. I highly recommend this place. Well worth going in :)
