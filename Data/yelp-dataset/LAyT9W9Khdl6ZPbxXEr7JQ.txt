4	Looking for a tooth whisperer? We've found one.Rick Ostler is a family dentist...but his specialty (at least in our book) is dealing with the squeemish dentist hater. Not only do they have TVs on the ceiling, you can bring in your favorite movie to watch during your procedure. They have a treasure chest with treats for the kids and snacks for everyone in the waiting room. Instead of smelling like a dentist's office, you will be greeted with the enticing aroma of fresh-baked cookies. Yum! And if you are lucky, you might just run into Mr. Molar or the tooth fairy.Oh. And did I mention that Dr. Ostler is a 'no guilt' dentist? Yup. No guilt. Ever. Just helps you fix what needs fixing in a very calm and gentle way. We call him the tooth whisperer. Not kidding.
5	The BEST dentist in Arizona! I am not one to write reviews let alone on a dentist but Dr Ostler and his staff are AMAZING!!! They are so patient and will never make you feel pressured in any way. After trying a few dentists who all gave me different opinions of what I needed done, I went to Dr Ostler after hearing my mom rave about his office. I wish I had gone to him sooner! He was very honest with what I needed and listened to all my concerns (I hate needless!) My entire family sees Dr Ostler including my two young brothers with autism. They love going to the dentist because everyone in the office makes them feel at ease. :) If you're looking for an honest, patient dentist who will really take the time to do the best dental work go to Ostler Family Dental!!!
5	The best dentist of all time!  I love the staff as well it's like the dream team of dentistry!  We drive from Queen Creek we love them that much!
