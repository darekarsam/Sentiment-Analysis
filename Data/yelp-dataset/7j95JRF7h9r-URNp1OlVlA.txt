5	Always fresh and filling. We order from work and the fries are crisp when delivered. Thanks to the staff for always being so helpful and making your customers happy.
3	Stopped in on a random afternoon for lunch.  The shop is in the same plaza as my office, so it seemed convenient.Appearance... right off the bat, the 'storefront' has little to offer.  Little to no decor, aged tables & chairs and a horrific odor that nearly made me leave upon entry.Service... there were two people there a young man, and a middle-aged woman. I wasn't greeted by either.  I placed my order, (the young man took the order), offered to upgrade to a value meal and cashed me out without incident.Quality...  Beverage selection was extremely limited.  They had two coolers, but only about a quarter full with limited sodas and bottled water.  I ordered a simply cold sandwich, with fries, both great tasting and hearty servings.  One small concern is the person preparing my food (the same young man who checked me out) accepted two cell phone calls while making my sandwich, one has to wonder how 'sanitary' his phone is!!!Overall a pretty average experience and slightly above average quality and portions.  Pricing and parking are excellent, location can be a bit hard to find, so just pull in the plaza at the corner of W. Sahara and Monte Christo.  Stop in for lunch and enjoy, just dont plan on bringing the family for a family outing!
