3	People have asked me why I like going to Wendy's for a burger.  You could go to McDonalds instead.   (And I do, often for breakfast.)  Or you could go to Burger King, for a Whopper (which I do, on Wednesdays, because it's only $1.99 for the Whopper, plus applicable taxes).  But there is a good reason to go to Wendy's.The reason I go to Wendy's is for a Grand Slam.There's a 1/4 pound Single.  There's a 1/2 pound Double.  There's a 3/4 pound Triple.  These burgers are on the menu.  The Grand Slam is an off-menu 1 pound quadruple burger that will satiate your desires for a four-patty dose of awesome.  A challenge for many, the Grand Slam is the winner for the meat-lover in your family when they want a burger.Plus, you can have a Frosty after your burger... something i definitely recommend.
1	I was in this location for lunch.  Shockingly, on going to the condiments station for some napkins and straws, there were ants all over the entire island!  In reporting this disgusting infestation to the manager, the manager stared back at me with a blank stare, as if she was confused or amused by our report.  Absolutely disgusting and unacceptable.  This should have never happened and this manager should have take much more decisive action to fix the problem immediately.
