5	My favorite place to get my haircut.
5	I love getting my hair cut here! I've been going to Tina for years and not once have I complained yet! The owner, Tina is super friendly and gives you tips and pointers when you can't decide on a cut. Her son, Marco, is also very nice and just as great as his mom.
4	Good place to get a haircut. Can sometimes be a hit or miss, but overall a good place.
4	I walked in to get a hair cut without an appointment. I was just looking for a place close to my home because I just moved to Vegas. I was pleasantly surprised by the way my hair cut turned out. I'm always nervous to get a hair cut and put it off as long as possible until I absolutely must go, and Carmella made me feel very comfortable and gave me great hair tips. :)  the only reason I'm not giving Tina's 5 stars is because it wasn't super clean in the salon.
5	They're the best when it comes to cleaning nails. The only problem is that only one person does it. Make sure to call and make an appointment before coming in.
