4	Very professional and personable help.  I am happy to have found Night and Day for future parties.
5	We worked with Night and Day Productions this past weekend and our experience was excellent.  We hired Christy and Dana to serve as hostesses/bartenders at my birthday party.  The girls arrived on time.  They were in the specified attire and looked beautiful.  Christy and Dana were both OUTSTANDING at their jobs.  They made all of the guests feel welcome, were very social and outgoing.  They are both excellent bartenders.  As instructed, they encouraged guests to drink more (hey, we were in Vegas!).  They were professional, warm, personable.  I would highly recommend this company and, in particular, Christy and Dana to work as hostesses or bartenders at any private party or event.  Numerous party guests commented that Christy and Dana really made our party wonderful.  We are so grateful to have hired them.
5	I celebrated my wedding anniversary in Las Vegas a week ago and hired a waitress from N&D Productions. Their customer service was great from the beginning. You'll get a lot of follow up to make sure you have an awesome experience. The waitress arrived on time, looking professional and was very helpful throughout the 4 hours. I definitely recommend Night & Day productions to cater your party!
