4	I was skeptical when Sweetie wanted to bring a Ziploc baggie full of old gold jewelry into a strip mall jewelry shop to see what they will give her for the gold value.  We walked in to Brownlee since my wife had obviously see one of those silly ads from the "Rock Doctor" or something.The man working was very nice and explained what he was going to do and after running some tests, and looking at everything with the loop magnifying glass he offered us WAY more than I was expecting for what we brought in.  AWESOME, it was like Christmas in March!  I couldn't believe it.  I was then curious about the economics of the whole deal and he went on to explain how he arrived at the number.  While he was testing everything I walked around and they had a nice selection of jewelry and the latest charm bracelets that have gotten so popular.  If you have some old gold jewelry laying that you don't want I'd suggest going to visit Brownlee and seeing what they can do for you.

4	My visit to this Brownlee, located at Stonecrest Shopping Center, was for a watch battery only.  The store is situated to the strip of stores to the left of Target that would run parallel with Ballantyne Commons Pkwy.  This is a small store, but carries a variety of types of jewels and watches.A battery was just under $10.  The young man that helped me quickly had the new battery in, set the watch, checked me out and I was on my way.  The next time I am in need of a watch battery, I wouldn't hesitate to stop in here.
5	Very helpful. Fixed a ceramic watch links for free even though I have not made the purchase there. Makes me want to visit them again.
