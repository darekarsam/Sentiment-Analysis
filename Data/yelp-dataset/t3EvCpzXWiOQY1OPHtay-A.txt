3	A cozy place to have breakfast..nice salmon bagel Wifi is a good plus!
5	Positively surprised!! The rating were ok so wasn't expecting much.. But wow I was impressed by the freshness and quality of all the ingredients! All the fruits seemed to be sliced right before served to me and they do fresh pressed fruits juice themselves. The toquoi eggs were excellent too. I'm very picky on coffe and this one was excellent.
