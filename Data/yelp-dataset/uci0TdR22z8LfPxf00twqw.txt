5	One of the best breakfast places in Montreal. You need a reservation for Saturday/Sunday brunch. For Montreal that says a lot. Before you order they bring you a tray full of very very good Sicilian pastries, coffee and a glass of juice. Included. Food is incredible. I love their eggs benedict and florentine. Did not like their shrimp omellette, but tastes differ. It was well done, not my food though. Highly recommended.

I would suggest getting the daily/weekly specials, I think they are worth it in terms of freshness and quality.  I would like to go back here and try out their brunch, but I am not dying to do so immediately since it is a bit pricier.  I had the eggplant appetizer and cod sicilian style -- and neither was amazing.  Someone else got the soup of the day and the special -- house gnocchi with gorgonzola -- and they were both really good.  The tiramisu tasted authentic and delicious.I spoke briefly to the chef, a lovely Sicilian woman who doesn't speak too much english/french, but is delighted to talk to you.  My waiter, who spoke perfect Italian, was actually Cuban, and was a great host.
