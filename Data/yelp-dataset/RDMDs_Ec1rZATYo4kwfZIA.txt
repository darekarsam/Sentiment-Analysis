4	I didn't go on one of the tours.  I actually didn't even mean to end up here.  It was only by chance, a forgetful mind, and an ill-timed thunderstorm that I happened upon the Molson brewery.  You see, I made sure that I remembered to pack my umbrella for my Montreal trip since the forecast called for rain...and then promptly forgot it in my hotel room.  Couple that with not knowing the city and my idea of 'just walking toward the port and seeing where I end up' and I ended up over by the Molsen brewery trying to dodge a deluge of rain by hiding in a little alcove of a building.  I didn't know it was the Molson building until a security guard came out and invited me inside.  Another afternoon saved by beer.They had a small gift shop and they let me meander around for the next 1/2 an hour until the rain let up enough that I wasn't going to get washed away.  I'm sure the tours are fun too, but I think I might have gotten a wee bit tipsy on just the fumes!
2	Keep moving people, there's nothing to see here...Seriously, with all due respect to the Molson (and Coors) establishment, there is really no reason to visit the Molson Brewery unless you REALLY want some Molson (or Coors) gear from their TINY gift shop. First of all, it is a bit of a hike from Vieux Montreal along Rue Notre Dame... and not a very scenic one at that. Secondly, there are no tours anymore -- this was stopped some time ago, so there's no free beer. Thirdly, the small (small) gift shop has more Coors paraphernalia than Molson -- and at that, it's mainly apparel.The place gets an extra star because the people were nice enough -- both the guard at the entrance I first (erroneously) went into (who was obliging and gave me explicit instructions on how to get to the actual gift shop three full blocks down the road), and the gal working in the gift shop (who was available for help and answered my dumb questions) were friendly enough and informative.
