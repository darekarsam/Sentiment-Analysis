1	Vehicle was in their lot, went to get it towed out. They wanted to charge, $170 for a 15 mile tow!! $79.00 hook up and$5.00/mile. They said don't worry about it your insurance will reimburse you. No wonder insurance rates are so high. Everyone else I called was $40-50 hook up fee and$3.50/mile. When we told the cashier we were using another towing service she became agitated, refused to give incoming tow driver any information or even hand him an envelope with drop off instructions. Said she could not process the credit to our credit card, had to be done through book keeping on Monday, really. Customer service definitely not a priority with this one. Have to say other woman I dealt with there was nothing but professional and a joy to deal with.
1	Although the representatives are relatively friendly, the company is very unprofessional, charges higher than standard storage rates, refuses to state formal policies and procedures, and behaves more like a seedy pawn shop than a legitimate business.
1	Vultures who prey on the misfortune of others.  Probably incestuous in their families, because who would want to socialize with any of them?  No mirrors in their houses, they can't stand to look at themselves in them.
1	If you want the leather and fabric in your car's seats covered in grease, then All City Towing is right for you!  I have no problem with their pricing or promptness, just the destruction of my car's interior.  If you value you car in the least, don't contract with these guys.
