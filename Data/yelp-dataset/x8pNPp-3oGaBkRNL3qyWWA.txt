4	Always a nice display of seasonal plants on offer.
4	This is quite a decent sized garden centre with a good range of plants, pots and other garden related items.  It also has a cafe, that I've not tried yet.  I like coming here as the range is quite big and is well laid out.  Definately a good start to get that garden sorted and planted with lots of colour!
