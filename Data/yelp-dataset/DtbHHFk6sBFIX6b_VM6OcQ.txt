3	Finally Edinburgh has a proper branch of Yo! No more cramming in to a tiny space on the top floor of Harvey Nicks.Being slap bang in the middle of Princes Street I'm sure this branch will prove popular, if just for convenience. It follows the tried and tested Yo! formula - sushi and other assorted bites on colour coded plates whizzing past you on a conveyor belt. It's nice to sit by the bar and gawp at the talent of the sushi chefs (seriously, how good must their knife skills be to slice fish that precisely?) but in this branch it would be worth napping a booth in the window and enjoying the view of the castle, gardens and shoppers below.Staff fairly friendly (and hopefully this won't wear off with time) and nothing to fault it. I'll definitely be back
