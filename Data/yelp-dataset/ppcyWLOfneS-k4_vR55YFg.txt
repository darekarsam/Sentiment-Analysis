5	My experience with RoundPoint was definitely worthy of 5 stars!  Not only did they have the best rates of any company that gave me a quote, my loan officer was also extremely knowledgeable and got back to me right away with answers to my questions.  I was able to close in less than 45 days and I would definitely describe the process as stress-free. You must be comfortable communicating via email and through a web portal but the system was a breeze to use and allowed me to return documents when it was convenient for me- after work or on the weekends.  Plus, the whole process was virtually paperless and extremely green.  I would highly recommend RoundPoint to anyone who is looking for the best rate and a company that is easy to work with.
1	You get what you pay for. Nobody gets back to you on time, process takes twice as long. The average response to my questions - 3-4 days!! Don't deal with this company.
1	What a terrible experience dealing with this company was. They are very helpful up front and review everything. HOWEVER, they mislead you and once their "work" is done, will not return calls or answer the phone. My appraisal came back at the price that the terms were negotiated and refi denied. When called to inquire, my once helpful agent who always answered the phone will not pick up the phone. Plus, they unethically changed themselves to my lender through my insurance company and even provided a loan number despite the loan not being approved...? Oh, and not to mention charges through my bank for requests made on their part. I would not recommend this company to anyone.
