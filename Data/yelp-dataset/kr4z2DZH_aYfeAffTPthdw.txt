5	Six Yelp Stars! !! !!! *** *** The whole staff here is wonderful!  I became a patient here in 2006 shortly after a friend had introduced me to Doctor Jennifer Helton, MD.   It is very important to me that a Physician is through, Doctor Helton is through, efficient and personable!  Doctor Helton is my favorite Dermatologist of all time!
5	We first started seeing Dr. Jim Rogers back in 1987 and our entire family has been patients of the practice since that time. Dr. Rogers is compassionate, thorough, caring and attentive. Do not hesitate to make an appointment with him should you need an excellent dermatologist.
1	My one star is based on their customer service only.  My botox service was great.I paid in full during my visit and shortly after received an invoice in the mail.  I want to ensure they are aware my invoice was paid so I left a message for Holly Smith in accounting.  No response, no return call.  I left 2 more messages over a period of time, begging someone to call me back, still no response.  I emailed them on Facebook, no response.  When you call the office it is impossible to get a live person.I have yet to receive any response to my multiple messages and I am beyond frustrated. Maybe this one star review will finally get someone's attention.They also do not accept Brilliant Distinctions points (I have never been to an office that was not part of this program) and when I called before my appointment, the receptionist said they did. I would not have gone to this office if I had received the correct information beforehand.I will not be back to this office, their customer service is non-existant.
