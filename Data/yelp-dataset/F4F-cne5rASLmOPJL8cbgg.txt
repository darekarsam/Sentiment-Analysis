5	This Wendy's is the best one in the area. Normally I don't eat at Wendy's but this place is right next to my work and is so convenient. But there are plenty of food places bear here so if it wasn't good, I really don't HAVE to go there. I go because the food is always great, their salads are fresh the chicken is cooked perfectly. The workers are wonderful. Tammy is amazing and helpful. I definitely recommend this Wendy's if you're looking for something quick and yummy.
2	No breakfast out of nowhere. Closest Wendys for breakfast is 59th and Thunderbird
1	Listening skills need work. Order was placed, repeated, and correctly charged; shorted a small fry & didn't get my burger as ordered (wanted to add bacon and take off onion, didn't happen). Service was okay. Thus is not the first time our order has been messed up but it will be the last. #Wendys location just lost a customer.
