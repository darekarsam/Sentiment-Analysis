3	Basic fast food style crepe place. I had a mushroom and cheese crepe which was entirely decent but really nothing exceptional. The have a $10 credit card minimum.
3	Snacktime at the Centre Eaton, my significant other and I found ourselves desperately seeking a bite to eat and a connection to the outside world that didn't cost us $15/1MB. I noticed the giant tub of Nutella proudly displayed in the front of Crepe De Gerard: sold. We got one with strawberries.For a silly American (what was it another sales clerk called me later on? Gringo?) like me, watching the woman behind the counter create the crepe on these giant hot plates was definitely a novelty. The result was a soft crepe with nutella and pleasantly warmed strawberries (yes, there is such a thing!) served with a Snapple that set us back about CAN$9. That seemed really, really steep, but hey, we were on vacation. All in all it was very delicious and I found myself scraping the plate for the leftover Nutella streaks.
1	We tried to enjoy crepes for dessert. Not only were we faced with rude service, but the crepes were some of the worst I have ever had. They over cooked them, smashed the fruit and they put on so much chocolate it was swimming in sweet. If you want authentic crepes, don't go here.
