3	Just so so. With many sub shops to chose from in the area this one does not stand out. The service was great. The sitting is limited. The. Prices were fair. The selection was okay. There was only one choice of bread. I didn't like it. Only one choice of size also. I probably won't go back.
1	Delivery? Not unless you live within walking distance! This Jimmy Johns only delivers within a MILE radius, and the customer service sucks. Not a great idea to come to San Tan Valley and offer delivery, and then limit it to a MILE radius.
2	Beware, I was shocked to find out they charge a delivery fee for each item. I ordered 3 sandwiches and was charged $4.09 delivery. That's $1.36 ea. Ridiculous, almost the cost of a sandwich.
1	Save your time and money. Sandwiches were bland at best. They offer no kids sandwiches nor will they customize a order to suit a child ( add lettuce and mayonnaise to a four dollar sandwich that comes with bread and meat only) All they had to say as well that's corporate for you. Apparently they're so freakishly fast because they cut every customer service corner they can. I personally will never step foot in a Jimmy John's again and I highly recommend you do the same.
