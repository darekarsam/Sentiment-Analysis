5	Everyone there is so pleasant.
5	Some of the friendliest people you will ever meet in the financial business.
5	I will never go back to a bank ever again. Credit Unions have won me over. No. UW Credit Union has won me over!This location in particular is the best location throughout the Madison and it's surrounding area. Unlike the other UW Credit unions I've gone to in Madison ( which is all of them) this location offers the more privacy. I can take care of my financial business without feeling like the better a counter over or behind me is in my conversation. As for the credit union itself, their are super fast! I mean Jimmy Johns fast. ( OK, horrible pun) but there have been a few occasions I've contacted them through their email system on their site and was sent a response in amazing time. - They offer great interest rates ( of course depending on credit score)- Have multiple ways of loaning money being: Credit Card, Paycheck Advancement, and Reserve Line of Credit- Overdraft Protection- Financial Classes offered. Usually these are for 1st time home buyers- Accurate and up-to-date- online banking- Transferring options- Mobile Banking including cashing checks with your phone- So much more!A few years ago, I needed to buy a car since my old one broke down on me. I applied for a loan on a Sunday night. I kid you not... by 10am the next day, I was approved and the money was in my account. I was blown away at how fast they work. Just awesome!My only issue is that they are obviously Wisconsin based so if you leave state and have to go to the ATM, you will be forced to pay fees. After becoming a member of UW Credit Union as a UW Madison Student, I left Associated Bank and never looked back. I am treated so much better as a customer.
