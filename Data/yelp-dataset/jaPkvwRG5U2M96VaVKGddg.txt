2	They offer new customers a better rate then existing customers.  We left after pointing out this was not showing customer appreciation.   Left 10 days before next billing period.   No refund.
5	Robert the manager was helpful and patient when we had questions and showed us around until we found what we wanted. Our unit is a non air conditioned locker that has been water tight and pest free for our entire usage  even during the monsoon. I would recommend these units to anyone needing a fairly low cost storage solution.
1	Also subject to unannounced rate increases.Put up with it for years but will be moving out now. Over a 48% net increase over 3 1/2 years. Look elsewhere.
5	This is by far the best storage place I have used. Fantastic customer service. I will definitely bring my business here again if I ever need another storage place because of the manager at this location!! Highly recommended based off of customer service!
5	Katie was super helpful getting me the right unit for my needs, at the right price - ask about their $1 move in special! No hidden costs, all terms and conditions were clearly explained upon move in.  Clean and gated facility, lights in units as well.  Helpful staff and moving boxes/locks available in office.
