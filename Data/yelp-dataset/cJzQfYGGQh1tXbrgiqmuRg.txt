5	i am way too picky when it comes to my clothes and I'm  always paranoid about the care instructions about how to go about properly cleaning them. i started taking my suits and nice tops to this place a while ago and i will never use another dry cleaners ever again. every time i pick up my clothes, i swear they look newer than when i first bought them. i always look sharp at work or when i go out to fancy places thanks to the wonderful things all star dry cleaners have done to and for my clothes. wine spill? no worries! plus, it feels even better to know that they use Eco-friendly products..that is just all around win. stop using other cleaners, come here!as a side note from the cleaning, the couple who operate this establishment are bloody brilliant!
1	To start my mama called 3 times this morning and someone would say hello then put the phone down and walk away or something.. So I thought maybe they were having trouble with their lines but it happened several times.. so we drove down there...I brought my mama in to have some dresses hemmed, I don't know why they advertise doing alterations because they DO NOT do them, they send them out.. which is ok but the lady has no clue how to measure or even have a measuring tape.She seemed nice but I'm not there to make friends I'm there for service... I can't comment on the dry cleaning as I wasn't there for that so maybe that's their specialty...but alterations is NOT...
