5	One of the best Mexican restaurants I've experienced...from the fresh warm tortilla chips, queso, green and red salsas, to the rice, beans, and entrees.Prices are very reasonable.We went on the glowing review from one of our neighbors.
4	This joint might only rate two stars in LA, but it's the best taco I've had on the East Coast. Get the tacos soft-shell and 'Mexican-style' with cilantro and radishes, delicious! Chicken enchilada was pretty good, the chalupa was just regular OK Tex-Mex fare. I wouldn't be surprised if there's a great 5-star authentic dinner somewhere on the menu, but our meal was a mix.Salsa verde with the chips was excellent.
