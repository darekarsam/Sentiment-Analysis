3	The store is filled with any snack or beverage you may desire while filling up. Plenty of pumps to use. There is a car wash that is in working order intermittently. The staff is friendly.
1	Rude employees. Seriously a bunch of haters. Went in looking for Fright Dome 2014 coupons. The website said they would have them here. Sure enough they did. I asked for two, and woman said take them all. (No thanks I still only need 2). I said, " I seen people have buy one get one coupons, do you know where I could get those at instead of the $5 off ones you have here" the cashiers reply," good luck, your not gonna ever find that". Well, guess what rude cashier. I found them. Muhaha. Maybe don't be such a sassy pants.
