4	Great beds! Good prices. Ok service .. Huh? Duh? Wha? I work at a tanning salon and last year at band camp.....
4	This location is the closest to my house and for that I am truly thankful because the other locations besides the Indian School location are absolutely AWFUL! The staff at this and the Indian School locations are by far the best! The ladies that work at both locations are very knowledgeable and friendly! both facilities are very clean and have a great vibe going on! when you walk in you are happy to be there where as other locations (the Tempe location) is like you are walking into a gas chamber.Thanks for being a friendly, knowledgeable and clean this makes me want to keep coming back! They have a great Yelp offer here so don't pass it up!  My only advice is by your own tanning lotion on amazon and don't pay the crazy prices for the lotion at the store when you can get the same exact things for half the price online.
2	I got a groupon for a month of tanning at any Celebrity Tanning location. I work all over the valley and went to 3 different locations and not one place was I impressed with the customer service, not friendly at all. I only went a total of 4 times because the staff just was not welcoming and seemed annoyed to have you come in and looked you up and down. This was not just this location.
5	This is also closet to my home. The girls were amazing. I told them it was my first time in. They explained everything thoroughly, including prices beds and lotions. I knew nothing whatsoever so they went ahead Nd walked me through the bed Nd it's functions very helpful and inviting.
5	Let me just say this location is by far the best in Phoenix!! Clean, nice new equipment, staff is knowledgable especially savannah she's definitely an asset to the establishment.
