5	I'm super happy to have Emerald in the neighborhood!  They have a full stock of pool chemicals & accessories at reasonable prices, a new construction/remodeling design center and a full service department.  We've been using Emerald to test our chemical levels (free) and make any necessary recommendations.  Every employee has been completely honest, expedient and extremely helpful without any of the annoying sales gimmicks you would expect from a pool supply store.  Sweet!
5	Great company, thanks for all your help.Larry
5	We're in the process of buying a house with a GREEN pool in the area (we live in CA at the moment). They came by last minute, and acid washed our pool, fixed it up for our inspection, and sent us pictures. The pool looks amazing now, and they totally helped us out in a bind! Everyone that works there is super friendly and helpful! :)
5	Have dealt with them for over a year! Each time very knowledgeable, total pros!!! 5 star company ! Honest , dependable most of all They Know What They Are Doing! Great product knowledge and all around great suggestions! Highly Recommend!
