5	When I arrived at the office with my children it felt like we were walking in to the Bahamas! The desk is a pirate ship and the chairs are real beach chairs. The staff was incredibly gentle with my children, and as weird as it sounds they want to go back! Every room and part of the office is decorated differently and full of fun for my kids.
5	Loved them! Well, as much as we can love a dental office. lol  The atmosphere is really neat and entertaining/ inviting for the kids. Josh at the front desk has always been super helpful and most importantly the awesome dentist Dr Brandon Grieve is incredible with the kiddos and very personable. My three kiddos will be his patients for as long as he's in Vegas and as long as they're kids!
5	New office with fun theme rooms.  Very kid friendly and engaging for little kids.  My kids are 3, 5 and 7 and loved the concept.  I really liked the staff including Dr. Brandon when we went for new appts and cleanings.  Today my 7 year old had to have several teeth extracted (his adult teeth were pushing through and the baby teeth weren't moving) and cavities filled. Dr. Brandon was absolutely fabulous. He did a great job clearly communicating with my son, explaining what was going to happen in a way that he could understand and was patient and empathetic to his questions and needs.  I liked him on the first visit but today's visit made me a loyal patient.  I appreciate the time and attention he took to take care of my son and because of that my son had a good visit even though extensive work needed to be done.  My son can be very sensitive and if he gets upset it can escalate quickly so I was a little nervous but Dr. Brandon has the perfect demeanor for working with kids! The front desk staff (Josh) was great at explaining our benefits and the treatment plan and when I checked out today the price was exactly what I expected.
