4	They've really fixed this bus station up, it looks like an airport now and is much cleaner! There isn't much to say except that it's a bus station, it gets busy, and has good and easy customer service.
4	The new and improved bus station of Montreal - completed and opened last year. What a contrast from the old, sad and dreary bus station! The new station is modern, clean, well lighted and organized. This is the ultimate hub for all bus traffic in and out of Montreal, from Greyhound to Orleans. A little bit further walk from the Berri-UQAM station but has easy access to the downtown area. Being in the new station feels much safer and cleaner for a frequent traveler.
