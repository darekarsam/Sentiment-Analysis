5	Dr. Kaocharoen is, hands down, the best dentist I've encountered. His approach is calm, friendly and scrupulously honest. I used to go to a dentist on Camelback and 44th who was very aggressive in scheduling services, and who told me I had a cavity that needed to be filled. Tired of the aggressive and frequent calls, I switched to Dr. Kaocharoen. He informed me that I had no cavity, and showed me the x-rays. Stacy, the hygenist, and Michelle, the intake/insurance guru, are also top notch and exceedingly friendly. While I now live in Bend, OR, I remain loyal to Dr. Kaocharoen and schedule my dentist visits for when I am in Arizona.
5	Dr Kaocharon is calm and gentle.  He is technically highly proficient and his manner is welcoming and caring.  We have our children and our other family members see him.His staff is excellent and he is extremely responsive to dental emergencies.  He is honest and does not over use tests.  His prices are fair and he can provide several treatment options for serious dental needs.The best and most professional dentist I have met thus far.
5	Fantastic guy - Very nice overall experience. This Dentist is upfront with you, but will tell you like it is. His work has been A+ and i'm pretty sure he saved me a root canal or two.  He cares about this craft and as the others have said hes gentle and skilled with his tool set. Most relaxing Dentist I have seen thus far. This is will be my 3rd visit soon and they also have very reasonable prices. No huge up-sell like most places - Super Sold Over all experience  - Covered both by last jobs insurances too. Kaocharon is a PRO - Unlike my last dentist; whom; just walked out of his office and Novocaine back.  ~Ba dum tsh!
