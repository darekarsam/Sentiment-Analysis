4	Lately, in my eating endeavors, there has been one thing that's been pushing its way in, desserts.  It really hasn't been something that I always was planning on doing, but it forced me to really start broadening my horizons.  The island of Montreal has so many restaurants that offer desserts on their menus.  Outside of that, there are places that specialize mainly in desserts.  If you look even deeper, you'll come across places that aren't really restaurants, but bakeries that happen to have seats and tables.  This happens to be one of those places.For what was a completely random back-up plan, Les p'tits plaisirs opened up my eyes to a new dimension of patisserie type locations where you can sit down and enjoy good dessert in Montreal.  For the reasonable price I paid, I got to sit down, have something I really enjoy and spend time being part of the fabric of Montreal in the midst of the Plaza.  Who knows, I might of lied to you when I told you I wasn't there right now having yet another piece of chocolate mousse cake.
3	a decent bakery at the beginning of plaza st-hubert.i enjoy their danish as well as their unsweetened hot chocolate. being able to control your sugar intake? awesome! other than that, can't really say as the place didn't really strike a cord in my being.apparently, they sell ice cream too but i've never try it so
