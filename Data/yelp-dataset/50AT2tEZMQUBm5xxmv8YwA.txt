1	Crap serviceWe couldn't get any service on ATT wireless at this location so we switched to Verizon. The world phone that my partner wanted had to be ordered, we were told "It should be here on Friday, I'll call you when it gets here"No call on Friday, Saturday, Monday or Tuesday or Wed so we called and the customer service person who had attended us said "It just got here!" .We drive over and she's gone for the day and there's a label on the box showing that it had indeed been delivered the previous Friday and she didn't call us.The young man who handled it then seemed very unhappy at having to spend time with us and sent us on our way with a non functioning phone, telling us that we'll get a text message soon.There was no text message or phone service and two days later we drive back to Verizon to find out that the second agent had failed to activate the phone or to tell us to do it both. Eight days to get a phone transfer, 2  days without any service, good going! FAIL!
5	After a really crappy experience w/ another sales rep @ the Ballantyne Village Verizon store earlier today, I was kinda reluctant to go back to Verizon. However, I decided to give it one more chance at a diff location and I can honestly say that Verizon is back in my good graces thanks to their rep Kyle who was sensational. He got my mom and myself squared away w/ brand new iphones, the family plan, and all the accessories we were jonsin' for without being pushy. He also went above and beyond and helped get us a discount. I was blissfully unaware my company had such a corporate discount, but he opened my eyes to that fact and saved me $ which he didn't have to do as I was a buyer regardless. His demeanor was COMPLETELY diff from the sales rep over in the Ballantyne Village store. This guy was smart, respectful, listened to what I wanted/needed and made it happen. Verizon, you are lucky to have this rep who exceeded my expectations and was a stand up guy!
