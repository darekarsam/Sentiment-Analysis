4	Edit: While the students who work here are rather inattentive, I love the lady at the cashier. She is so sweet and easy to talk with, I can't help relent one more star for her. Otherwise, service is still around a 3 for late packets (though I finally got mine today, after the 3rd inquiry).Original: 3 stars is generous. Honestly, I miss Notes n' Quotes. I feel bad rating this establishment with such a low rating, but students should not have to visit a store 5+ times to check and see if a course packet is in stock. It should simply be in stock. Further, they no longer let you request an item by phone or by online contact. You have to buy the packet in store. With hours from 9am-7pm, that's not horrible, but not that great for students with part time jobs and such.Hopefully, service will improve by next semester.
