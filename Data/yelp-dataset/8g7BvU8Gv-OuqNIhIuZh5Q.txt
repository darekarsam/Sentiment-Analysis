4	I prefer to do it myself at home but, this is a pretty decent car wash when in a pinch and your car needs to be cleaned. It is a brushless carwash were you pay and then pull in and your car is cleaned. It does a surprisingly decent job too.There are a couple of do it yourself bays also.
4	Well worth the $50 Groupon for full detailing! The two guys running the joint were nice and accommodating to some last minute changes in the Saturday appointment. They thoroughly cleaned the inside and outside of my poor Jetta that hadn't been cleaned in nearly 3 years, and were genuinely appreciative of the tip (which I appreciate). They also seem to have some do-it-yourself bays with vacuum and air pumps, but I suggest letting the pros do it!
5	I had the $99 full auto detailing done. They did a great job, but the most impressive part was the service. Joey noticed that I had nowhere to go, so he drove me to a nearby shopping plaza so I could hang out for a few hours, and then picked me up when my car was ready. Totally impressed, and highly recommended. What a great deal.
5	I used my $50 Living Social deal for the full auto detailing and was so pleased with their service! In less than two hours my car was spotless and shiny inside and out. While I waited for my car to be done, the owner took me to a nearby coffee shop to kill time. Definitely plan to go back!
1	I had the Groupon for this service. It left white splotches in my car (even after it dried) and took an hour longer than he said he was going to. It is in the ghetto and there is nowhere to sit while you are waiting.
