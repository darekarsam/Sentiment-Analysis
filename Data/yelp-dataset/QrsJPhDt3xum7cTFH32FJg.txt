4	First things first....don't take your kids here late at night looking for some rustic Italian pizza experience...its a pretty rough & tumble locale. Aside from that...I thought the pizza here was very good. I travel a lot to NJ/CT/NY and the pie isn't as good as some of the more famous joints in that area...but hey...your in Pittsburgh and not New Haven. Order the pie well done....tell them to basically burn it and that you won't complain and you will get a very, very nice pie. Plus...where else can you get a 40 while you wait for your pie? Bring change for the meter and the for the guy that needs 0.50 to get home.

4	Love this place!  Pizza is great and they deliver all over the city.  This restaurant is also on the Eat24 app, which is awesome (it even lets you tip the driver via the app). Buffalo fries are delicious and lightly spicy.  Hoagies are HUGE and normally enough for two meals (dinner & then lunch).  Pizza is a little more pricey than I would like, but very good - and there are tons of options. Delivery drivers have always been friendly and quick.  I definitely recommend!
