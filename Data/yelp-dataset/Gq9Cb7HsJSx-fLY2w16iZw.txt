3	Stopped here for dinner with the family.Atmosphere:  this is the best thing about the restaurant.  There are both outdoor and indoor seating areas available.  We went indoors since it was pretty chilly outside.  There's a large variety of seating for different sized groups.  The interior is done in a wonderful Spanish style, utilizing the colors and patterns one would expect.  It was definitely a comfortable atmosphere.Staff:  we had no issues with service here.  Of course, the place was practically dead on a Sunday night, so I didn't expect any problems.  They were polite and attentive and ensured we received the correct orders.Food:  I wasn't impressed with it at all.  We went with the Tapas and each selected two items from the menu to contribute to the overall Tapas.  I was sadly disappointed to see that each order was ridiculously small.  We were a group of 7 and though we ordered two items each, it was sadly lacking.  The food was bland to say the least.If you want to sit down and have some drinks friends in a fantastic atmosphere, this is the place to go.  If you want to good meal for a decent price, I'd recommend walking further down the road.
