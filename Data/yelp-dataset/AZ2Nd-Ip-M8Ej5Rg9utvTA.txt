3	What happened to original wranglers? Seriously, if I wanted to pay $150 for a pair of jeans with a bedazzled butt, I'd go to the mall. At least the girl was helpful & nice.

Note to management:  If you hire a bunch of young good-looking people, they are going to stand around jabbering with each other all day, and their annoying friends are going to come in too, and not buy anything.  Mix it up.  Hire some old ladies who will disapprove of this behavior, and someone like me who will make fun of them.Anyway, the 2nd time was the charm.  I was in there right before Christmas to get Mr. M some shiny new boots since he has been trail riding in old Nikes.  It's time for him to look like the sexy cowboy that he is.  The store was decorated very festively for the holiday and the staff were very friendly and helpful, and when I asked about gift wrap, they said sorry, they don't do that, but did provide me with a nice box and some bows.  They have a great selection of all the western wear you could need and I think the prices are competitive.  I used to be a full-time cowgirl.  This store makes me want to chuck my corporate job and ride horses for a living again.
