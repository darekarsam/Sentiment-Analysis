5	Nice little Irish pub in Karlsruhe, where you can find whichever Anglophiles and English-speakers aren't occupying the stools of the Bray Head (t'other Irish pub, near Durlacher Tor).Scruffy's has gorgeous dark wood everything, from barstools to ceiling beams, English-speaking bartenders and British beers on tap, and some truly fun music nights with performances from various local bands. I've had a really nice time every time I've been there.
5	The authentic Irish pub. The place is dark, crowded and you need to grab the drinks yourself. Rustic wooden tables and benches.Enjoy an Irish beer, cider or whiskey there. Live music is also part of the deal (not everyday though).
