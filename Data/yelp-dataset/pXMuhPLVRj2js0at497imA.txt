5	John at Service King on raintree in Scottsdale was exceptional. Not only did his team repair my brand new truck to "new factory condition" but also aligned the tires and took time to ensure the truck was perfect! would definitely come back. They even text you and give updates on completion times, % done, etc!
5	Fabulous experience!Took my insurance's suggestion and used Service King for some body work. Was extremely impressed from start to finish. I dropped by one day for estimate and scheduled vehicle drop off for the following week. My service advisor, Kevin, explained everything to me and mentioned that he would update me throughout the process. In addition to their great location, they also work side by side with Enterprise Rentals, so arrange to have you picked up and dropped off. Beginning the day after drop-off, I received text updates each morning and evening on the status of my vehicle, which I soooo appreciated! Kevin also left me voicemails so I knew exactly when my car would be done. Seamless process in my opinion. Service King definitely gets a thumbs up from me!
5	Service King did a great job with my daughter's PT Cruiser.  She hit a fallen tree in the recent monsoon rain storms in Phoenix.  They arranged for Enterprise rent-a-car to pick me up and sent text messages to keep me updated on the progress.  Car was done on the exact day predicted.  I expected them to clean the outside but was blown away that they also cleaned the inside of the car.  Not a full detail - but clearly a good vacuum etc.  The biggest issue was that one of the doors would not open properly.  They fixed that right in the parking lot the day I came in for the estimate because I needed a few more days before I could leave it with them!
