5	Five Stars Plus Plus!  We are both native New Yorkers, and have been on a quest for the last 28 years here in Arizona to find the perfect New York pizza.  We've taste-tested all over town, and we are so lucky to have found Gus's.  His pizza reminds us of home.  The ingredients are perfect - the crust is fantastic.  The restaurant is clean and the service and the staff are friendly and inviting.  We are now loyal weekly patrons, and are so happy to have him in our neighborhood.
4	Ordered delivery of their yummy toasted sandwiches.  Delicious sandwiches and fast delivery.  Recommend the chicken parm sandwich
4	I am from Chicago, and was very impressed with this NY style pizza. If they cooked it a bit longer and square cut it, I'd feel right at home. I kept it simple with a slice of pepperoni and a slice of BBQ chicken. The crust is almost crispy enough to NOT have to fold it in half to eat it. They have a nice deal for lunch if you're super hungry. $4.99-All You Can Eat Pizza. The value shines if you go for a 3rd slice. Good luck with that..... I'd swing by for a slice one in awhile, but its not exactly my thing...
