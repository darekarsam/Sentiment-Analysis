4	On my most recent girlfriend excursion and shopping trip...when it was almost done (still had to shop at Concord Mills on the way home, of course!)..yes, I went to church!  A very large and open airy church.  Contemporary, yes, but still traditional in its values and setting with the pews and kneelers.  That made me feel much better.  Not only was the church beautiful at Christmas time and the 2nd Sunday of Advent, but the current priest was leaving for another congregation, right down the road.  He was very funny and I am sure the parishioners enjoyed having him there.  The parishioners all felt connected and at peace in their church and it was warm and inviting, even for a visitor.Connecting with God every weekend, whether in your home church or visiting one far away from home, he is always with you.  It does help to experience other types of churches from time to time to appreciate your home church.
4	My family has been going to this church ever since we moved to Charlotte.  It has been fun watching this church grow over the years.... My dad used to attend mass here before the main sanctuary was built so they had to literally grab their own folding chair when mass was held in the gym and put it back after mass was complete.Also went to CCHS and my graduation ceremony was held here so this church has really been a large part of my life.
2	This church is close to our home but the community is just to large compared to what I am used to.  The parish community is friendly and welcoming but due to its large size just overwelming.  The mass and music are not traditional to what I am accustom to, but are instead more contempary.  I have been to Catholic churches in various states and countries.
4	This church is growing on our family.  We tried others but kept coming back here.  While it will never be what we had in Indiana, this church has the ability to keep reeling you back.
