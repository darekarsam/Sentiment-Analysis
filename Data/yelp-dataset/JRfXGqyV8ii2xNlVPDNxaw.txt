5	Greatest customer service, hands down. I wanted a diamond wrap for my solitaire and went to a few "stand alone" jewelry stores. I was not only made to feel uncomfortable but also condescended to during the process.  The staff at Reeds are amazing. They understood what I was looking for and never questioned my ideas. What happened? I found exactly what I was looking for and left happy. Great job Reeds.
