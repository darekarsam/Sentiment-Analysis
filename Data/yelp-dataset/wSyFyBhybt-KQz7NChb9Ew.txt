5	The stated address is incorrect. Per http://www.charlottetrolley.org/ , the address is actually at 1507 Camden Rd, Charlotte, NC 28203.We found out about this place from a AAA street map of Charlotte, and decided to stop by. Finding parking was a trifle difficult. The museum itself is rather small, contains one rebuilt car, several HO-scale dioramas, and a very helpful staff member who showed us a stack of pictures of the discovery and extraction of car 85, which had formed the central spaces for a house! (It has since been restored, and can be found somewhere on the light rail line, supposedly.)If you like trains or trolleys, you should go. If you like Charlotte history, you should go. This was a pretty good museum for the subject.
1	I have tried many times to take my boys here. Today the 21st of August I tried again. It says that the hours are 1pm til 5 pm. This museum is never open!! Can anyone tell me why? My boys are officially done with trying to visit. The last time we were able to go in was 2 years ago when Santa was there. I called and I was sent to a mail box. Great way to make people want to come visit.
