5	I always have excellent results with Sue!    In fact, I trust no one else with my Botox!!  Sue is extremely knowledgeable and and experienced.  She goes out of her way for her clients and is professional, yet down-to-earth.   I would definitely recommend her to others.
5	Sue is amazing. She is very down to earth , easy to talk to , attentive and understanding. I have been seeing her for over three years. Not only is she skilled but her prices are amazing! For the level of service you get you would normally pay a lot more. Not only does sue know what she is doing but you really get your money's worth!!!!!
5	This is the best botox treatment I have ever had.  I have been getting botox for the last 10 years, and I have had perfect results.  I highly recommend on trying Sue! I am happy I did, and now I will be a loyal customer!
5	Nikki H.  Please get your facts straight.  The Sandra to whom you were referred is NOT Sandra Rennert or Sandra Bledsoe.  Sandra Rennert/Bledsoe works out of her house in Reno, NV.  You have hurt several peoples' reputations by not checking your facts.  You should apologize to Kathy, Sue, Sandra and Dr. Brian Parker for your damaging comments. And, yes, I will be seeing Sandra.
5	I had a treatment performed recently by Susan here and her skills are amazing.  She listens to what your concerns are as well as what your desired effects might be and spends as much time as is needed to make you look your absolute best.  She's extremely experienced and so kind and pleasant to deal with.  She even offers to give you touch ups, if needed.  I honestly would never go to anyone else. She's the best!
