4	Pita pit is great food, that is cooked right when you order it, so you know it's fresh. It's never too crowded, which is good for me, because that means I get the yumminess that is Pita Pit that much faster. :-) Lots of choices that are made to order. My favorite is the chicken Cesar pita. Delivery takes a little while, so it's best to pick up.  It's open late...I think until 3ish.
5	This is my favorite place to eat in Champaign-Urbana. The pitas are amazing, the service is fast, and the employees are friendly. I see the owner working in there every time I go, and he is always happy and friendly. I hope they bring one to my home-town! Two thumbs up for the Pita Pit!
2	This place is over-rated.  It's a place that opened up after my time, but I had heard great things about it and I tried it the last time I was there.  It was just like the "2 star" thing says... "meh".I'm sure it does well with the student population down in school, cuz it's pretty fast and cheap.  But if you want real pita sandwiches, falafel and what not, come up to the Chicago-area and you'll love some of the stuff up here.
