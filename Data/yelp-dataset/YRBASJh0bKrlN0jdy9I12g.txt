1	By far the WORST pedicure I have ever had.  Toenails were trimmed unevenly, cuticles were not cleaned up, polish was applied unevenly and streaky(didn't even last 3 days), toenails were not cleaned up. No massage.  No lotion...nothing. It was a horrible experience and to make it worse......I was charged $30.00!
5	I LOVE this place, I've been coming here for close to 5 years. Never a problem here. They take care of their customers. They make sure you leave happy with whatever service you've had done. They are always busy, they take walk-ins but it's best to make an appointment.
