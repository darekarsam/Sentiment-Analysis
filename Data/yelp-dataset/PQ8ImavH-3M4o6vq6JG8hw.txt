4	It was a cold rainy in late May, the perfect day to accidentally forget that I'd brought my lunch to the office because SCHNITZEL!I had the schnitzel plate that is served with two sides. I had their German Pickle salad along with a mound of crispy sweet french fries. The fries were amazing with the curry wurst dipping sauce as was the crispy, perfectly fried chicken schnitzel.  While the plan was to bring the lunch back to the office in pristine and showcase ready condition we barely made it 5 feet before pecking away at the edges of this mitt-full of food. This is no box of MacDonald's take-out that offers no temptation.  No, this meal beckons to you in no uncertain terms to have "just one nibble. Go on, just one..." The pickle salad was not made of pickles as I'd hoped but rather with cucumbers. Super tasty, the crunchiness of the sliced cukes and the creamy dill dressing balanced the tangy curry wurst sauce beautifully. OMG So good!
4	Pretty good meal for the priceI would highly recommend trying the DBL which is 2 schnitzel with cheese and BACON in the middle. Reasonable price at 6$ and amazingly good, especialy the with the BBQ sauce and bacon in the middle.Few german dessert options would be awsome but amazing truck overall
