5	Great gelatos and sorbets. I like the friendly shop, and I like the cute minimal seating. The chairs however, are not made for grown men. Everybody is happy when they come here, and still when they leave. Love the flavor.
4	Little corner shop situated in the heart of plateau of Mont-Royal. Decided to stop by with the wife and have ourselves some ice cream. I took a 2 scoop sugar ice cream cone with one being cafe and the other being stracciatella. The cafe ice cream is palpable. Sooooo yumm!Service is extremely friendly and polite and left a great impression on me.The price tag is a bit steep but what ice cream store isn't?Will definitely visit again.
