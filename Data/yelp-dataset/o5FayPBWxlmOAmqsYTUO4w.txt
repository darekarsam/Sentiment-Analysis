4	Super tasty tteokbokki appetizer.They need to make an main-sized version of it, I'd stuff my facehole with that on a regular basis.The jeyuk bokkeum was good too, just not spicy enough for us.But when we told our waiter he assured us that he will remember us & next time we visit it will be much spicier... Score! Oh and they have a terrace, so summery Korean food moments are an option.
5	Delicious! Very authentic Korean cuisine. Friendly staff and great atmosphere. Definitely will go back.
4	Hey we just finished eating at a modest looking Resto but they serve amazing Korean food Best part is the chef He walks around we can talk to him and place the order after listening to how he will prepare the meal I had a wonderful silky tofu soup with seafood and a soft poached egg on top Hot and spicy and it really warmed us up Next were small tapas sized plated of fried kimchi ,sweet potatoes ,and a couple of other delicious delicacies And the main was super tasty beef ribs Mmmmm they are a treat The rice sides were pink colored and the taste was like eating rice with cotton candy Luckily we had room to Shaw a bowl of red bean ice cream And a few slices of fresh apples Great food and very moderate pricing Nice ambiance quiet and peaceful music Enjoy this place H
5	Can't believe Montreal have this good tasting Korean place. Passed by this place several times but finally deceived to try it after my friend recommended it. The exterior looked old and unwelcoming, but the interior was warm and clean. We ordered seafood tofu soup, kimchi pancake, beef stew, bibibum and raw tofu with sauce. Everything tasted so good. Definitely will come back if I was in mood for Korean.Also, there service was fantastic!
