5	Am I impressed!  We live in Scottsdale and Del arrived on time (even a few minutes early!) was professional and extremely thorough.  My rugs look new again and smell great!  Thank you 3D Home Services!
5	Del cleaned our light beige carpets this morning in the rental house we're moving out of. We were afraid the large spots where we spilled red Koolaid and orange soda would be there forever, and we wouldn't get our damage deposit back. Plus there were dirty areas in front of the couches even though we always take off our shoes. There is even carpet in the bathroom. Del cleaned the carpets in every room. After about 2 hours, the carpets looked like new, no kidding. I just about fell over. This is after we had used everything, including another professional, a steam treatment, and all kinds of home remedies on the stains. Our landlord is going to give us our entire damage deposit back and the next renters are going to love us - and 3D. Wow.
5	We have used the services of 3D (Del and family) a couple of times for carpet cleaning. He and his wife are so sweet and professional. Their work is excellent and I am always happy with the outcome. They even take the time to spray carpet freshener after the cleaning. I am so happy to support a small family centered company that does such great work. I will undoubtably be using this company for future jobs! Thank you Del and Vikki!
