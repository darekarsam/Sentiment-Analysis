4	We're already fans of the original F+F Pizza in St-Henri and consider it a solid takeout/delivery option.  Tonight we got to eat in at the new location in The Village, as we were invited to the soft launch.In contrast to the St-Henri location, which is on the rugged and grungy side, the decor here is more sleek and clean.As far as we're concerned, THIS is why you come here: good pizza, specialty hot sauces (see picture above) and Carlsberg beer!F+F Pizza is a nice addition to the burgeoning Village dining scene.  It's a great neighborhood restaurant that locals will certainly enjoy.
4	Warning, food is quite heavy...actually it's probably because I had a whole 9 " pizza for myself plus couple more slices from another pizza. Anyways! Service is very professional, for sure. I ordered a Mexican pizza, but instead got a different styled one. The waitress insisted she give it to me on the house even after I refused out of not caring so much. I took up on her offer and she told the kitchen to make me my initial order, the Mexican.My pizza, the wrong order and the good one were both good. I liked the Mexican more and the waitress helped me pick a hot sauce too to go with it! (They had SO many different hot sauces to choose from because her boss travels a lot, so he brings back different sauces)If you're looking for decent cheap pizzas (around $12-14 for 9") check this place out. They also have a 5 a 7  which is 2 beers for the price of one!
3	You are better off eating on the premises.Lots of changes in ownership, and  I can show you pictures of burned delivered pizzas and being blamed for the whole thing...at you won risks, but taste is good
