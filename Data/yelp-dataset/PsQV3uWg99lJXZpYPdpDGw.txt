3	They used to have a sofa at the back of K2. A bit leather one which they invited you to sit on whilst you waited for your food. Then one day, I went in, and the sofa was gone. Now I don't see the point. I think it's because I, and plenty of other people I know, kept going into K2, ordering food then falling asleep on the sofa - this was due exclusively to tiredness you understand, nothing else.I know, I know, it's a curry house, not a bloody lounge. And, as far as the food goes, it's pretty good. Fairly standard, but tasty nevertheless. They have a quite funny offer on where you get a free can of pop with a meal. But the only cans you're allowed are rolla cola and dandilion and burdock. Maybe cream soda too. It's also cheap - you'll not pay more than a fiver for anything. So all in all, it's a pretty good take away. But it was so much better when they had the bed. Sorry, sofa.
2	I wanted to like this place but as a delivery option, it fell short of expectations.  First, it took 1.25 hours for delivery (on a non-snowy Edinburgh evening), second, the doner kabab w/ chips that I ordered was missing the chips + the garlic sauce that it was to have come with.  Lettuce was a bit on the dried/old side and only 2 slivers of tomatoes were included in the salad.  Third, there was a curry sauce in there that had more than the usual amount of oil floating to the top.  I think I'd come back to give it another try, since the price is fair -- however, I'd avoid delivery and do take-away instead.
