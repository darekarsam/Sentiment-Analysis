5	I recently went to a dinner party where the hostess was serving the most amazing Russian blinis with creme fraiche and the richest, thickest creamiest butter I've ever had in my life. When I asked her where she got everything she told me about Patisserie Vova.A bakery and goods store which specializes in Russian treats, if you're into trying out new things then Patisserie Vova is for you. I found the amazing butter, which turns out is pure, New Zealand butter and probably the best variety you'll ever have the good luck to taste in your life. I also saw tons of biscuits, varieties of jams I have not seen elsewhere like black currant, elderberry and lindenberry. Also lots of breads and cold cuts are on hand.The lady who runs the shop is also very friendly and if Russian food is new for you, she explains everything , I walked out with a lot more than expected.
