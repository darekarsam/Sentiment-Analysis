4	I love this place, they always have nice and fresh cuts meats, blood sausage, smoked pork ribs, chops, you name it and they have it. They have a wide assortment of European foodstuff, imported cookies, cakes, spices, and also a deli section with very good smoked meat, sausages, hot dogs, all ready to eat and at very reasonable prices along with decent customer service.
5	I usually get the sliced veal sandwich with dijon or the sausage sandwich with sauerkraut and dijon mustard. Simple, cheap and delicious. What more can you ask for? A veal sandwich and a black cherry soda came to $5.75 when I passed by Slovenia on Saturday.YUMMY!
2	Not a bad place for a sandwich, but I got the duck with baugette bread and it wasnt very tasty.  I tried my dads roast beef sandwich and it didnt fair much better.   They didnt have fries, and the chips they gave us were baked and I HATE that.  The service was excellent, but thats about it.
4	We got take out sausage sandwiches, some marinated cabbage and some sausage. The sausage sandwiches were divine, soooo goodWe made some cabbage stew with the cabbage and sausage, it was so goooooooood!The only down side is that they do not have a sitting area.... but it's a grocery shop anyways
