5	This is every girlie-slightly-obsessive-compulsive fashionista's dream closet :-)                       All things cute and in their place just makes you feel relaxed & happy.... or is that just me? Lol!  The place has an open floor plan, but it's arranged by colors. All items are well organized & you can easily see their great selection of clothing & accessories without having to rummage. Those who know me know that I don't like rummaging when I'm shopping, it totally stresses me out. The location is spotlessly clean, the staff is very friendly.
5	Why didn't this place exist when I was a pre-teen? I would have spent all my quarters here! Luckily Charming Charlies is still appropriate for grown up kids as well and I love to visit. Just recently, I paid my first visit to the Downtown Phoenix location and I was incredibly impressed. This two story location is clean, filled with great low-priced finds and the staff is very friendly. For those of you who don't know what Charming Charlies is, I will explain a little more. It's a costume jewelry's paradise. It has every piece of costume jewelry imaginable and in every different color. In fact, they organize the store based on color which makes it a lot easier. Besides jewelry, they also carry hats, scarves, clothes and accessories. It's a great place to buy yourself a gift or a friend a gift! I was also happy to learn that they stay open until 9 most night. That's a good sign for the growth of Downtown Phoenix!
5	I go here every once in a while. Today I received amazing customer service! Everyone was so nice and helpful. I got a greeting when I arrived and when I left. The lady with the short red hair (sorry I forgot your name) was very helpful. I picked up a few shirts and she took them up to the register for me so I wouldn't have to hold them.  Maura checked me out and the total was correct. Overall the staff was great and everyone had a smile! The store was clean and I got a bunch of stuff and with the sale on clearance jewelry I saved a bunch. Can't wait to go back! Keep up the great work ladies! :)
