4	It's the new Chinese fast food buffet that took over Coreana's old space. As a transplant from Hawaii who is very used to quality Chinese food, I've been SUPER disappointed in the Chinese food in Madison. Not to mention as an employee near this establishment, I've been bummed at the lack of decent lunch options. SEARCH NO MORE. This is the best mediocre Chinese food I've found in Madison. It's not the best ever of Chinese, the rice was just a tad under-watered in the cooking, my friend who had the noodles wasn't super impressed... but the entrees were just fine. Price is very reasonable. I'm happy they're part of the neighborhood. =) They're definitely better than Coreana, whose food sucked, imho.
5	Don't confuse QQ Express (which is the University Ave restaurant ) with the QQ Asian Buffet on the North side.  Owner Lin Guo Zhi (who started the northside restaurant but left to start Express) is an excellent chef.  While this establishment has an extensive buffet, we order off the menu.  Ask for the string beans with pork, the hot and spicy chicken ding or the pork bao-zi.  With a large Chinese student body during the school year, more traditional Chinese dishes are available, but you have to ask.  If you know you will be going a certain time, call ahead to try to get a whole steamed fish--as good as I had in China.  Table service gets a little hectic during normal meal times, so if you're going to order off the menu instead of the buffet, it can be a little slow but definitely worth the wait.
