5	You want great Italian food? Great drinks? Come here. Great service and the music makes it really feel like you're in the middle of Rome. I've been going for years and it doesn't get any better than this.
3	Just your average pasta restaurant. Not bad, not amazing. Fast service. Really the kind of place you go and you feel like "what the hell can I write in my review ??"It's average ?It's ok ?A blind chameleon will still match colours with its surroundings. At least you learnt something with this review.
3	The waiters are not very professional but this restaurant still worthy for the food and price.I ordered a bruscetta and a scaloppine parmigiana. My wife chose the mafioso plate, all plates were good. We had a small issue because they brought a wrong plate for me but it wasn't a big deal because I've been in this place a few times and sometimes this happen, especially when the waiter is new.I recommend the restaurant if you want to eat italian food at a good price.
3	Not bad Italian restaurant around Brossard, QC. I had a good bruschetta and Cannelloni Romana. The Cannelloni was just OK. I also thought the dish could be a bit bigger than just 3 rolls and come with less sauce. Luckily there was couple breads on the table so I didn't end up hungry. I though it was a bit pricey for the quality of the food and the waiter was unprepared for the role.
