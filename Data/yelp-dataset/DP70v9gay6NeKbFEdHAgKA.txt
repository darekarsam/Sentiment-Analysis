3	Now I know that I'm not only getting old, but I'm going blind as well.  The bi-annual (ish) trip to the eye doctor resulted not in the typical in-and-out (and not the hamburger), but in a drawn-out, lengthy "1 or 2", "3 or 4" session, as if I was stuck in the midst of filming for a Deck the Halls sequel.  At least it is the holiday season.I can't blame it on Dr. Musler either that I am getting older or going blind, so I suppose I have to rate their service, and on that front, they are decent.  Generally having quite good eyesight - until now, at least - I can't compare much, but they do a serviceable job getting you in and out, even if they aren't overly friendly or if there is much to do for kids while they wait impatiently.Where I will give them the nod is that they take our insurance (generously provided at no small cost by our employer), where many others in town don't.  I can't explain why eye doctors wouldn't take vision insurance, but hey - we pay for it, it is nice that at least someone takes it.
5	Just finished with my eye appointment and the staff was awesome as usual. Props to Dr. McCoy too. She's very professional and friendly. I look forward to my visit next year!
5	I started going to Dr Musler years ago and I've never had a bad experience. I moved to DC in 2008, but returned in 2012, and started going back to Dr Musler at the SouthPark location. The staff is always pleasant and efficient, and Dr Musler has a very calming persona. He is very intelligent and is passionate about his career. I can't imagine going to any other optometrist for my eye care needs!
1	Worst experience I've ever had in my life at the Carolina place mall beware!!! The receptionists are very rude and one of them hung up on me before telling me that maybe she might get back to me? What kind of business are these people trying to run?
