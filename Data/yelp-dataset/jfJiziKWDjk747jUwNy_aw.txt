2	This is my local pharmacy and I must admit I"m not very impressed.  They either give me the wrong amount of my prescription or they forget to list whether there are refills or not.  I'd suggest to check everything before you leave the store.
2	Looks like very other cvs. The store is the only reason they get two stars. Unfortunately I usually come here for the pharmacy. They are so slow and are not any help. If it wasn't for the convenience of it being next to my dr I would never come here.
