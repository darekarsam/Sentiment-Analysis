3	If you're in Phoenix, you have approximately a 99% likelihood of finding a Circle K, 7-11, AM-PM, QT, or a Walgreens at any major intersection, sometimes you'll even find more than one. While you may be surprised to think of a drug store like Walgreens in the same category as convenience stores, it seems that the aging of the baby boom generation means that shoppers don't just need convenient beer and sodas, they also need convenient prescription drugs.This is one of the many Walgreens built during the past decade throughout Phoenix and it is pretty standard. All of the items you could need including snacks, sundries, toiletries, greeting cards, seasonal items, and a pharmacy for the aforementioned prescription drugs.Parking is easy to get to and convenient to the store and this Walgreens is located at a good location near the Christown Mall and Phoenix Baptist Hospital.
5	this Walgreen is convenient, right next to the montebello light rail stop and on 19th. Look for the walgreen bucks before buying and save that money! You can use the walgreens bucks that same day for your next purchase! They also have a private lot woohoo!
5	I am visiting the area to see a friend and have been going to this Walgreens to pick up little things since it is close by. I'm so surprised with how the staff treats me, I feel like I'm back home. I don't know any names but the man that stands at the door with spiky hair and the woman that was working the cosmetic counter with dark hair were so nice. It actually makes me pick going there over Target which is right next to it for the little things I need. Always enjoy being treated nicely and a good atmosphere, good job on the hiring Walgreens!
