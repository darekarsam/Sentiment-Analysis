5	Recently, I was referred to Jay's Plumbing for a second opinion regarding an issue with my sewer pipes.  I had made the mistake of calling another plumbing company to unclog my drain, and they told me that a sewer fitting underneath my foundation had separated and would cost in excess of $3000 to repair.Curt, the owner of Jay's Plumbing was honest and forthcoming.  His technician, Jerry was very thorough and efficient.  Jerry conducted a video inspection of the sewer line and DID NOT find a separation or any other issues.  He took the time to explain everything that the camera revealed during the video inspection.The personnel from Jay's Plumbing were ethical and charged a reasonable price for their service.  I would highly recommend them for any plumbing issue.
5	Jerry with Jay's Plumbing & Service is outstanding.  He goes the extra mile to ensure that everything is working correctly when he leaves.  He will not be satisfied until the problem is 100% solved.  Previously another company had come in to try to unblock my sewer.  The representative from the other company cursed as he became more and more frustrated with the clog, he chipped my bathroom door trying to get a machine too big to go through, and allowed water from the toilet to go through the wall and into the carpet on the other side.  He left me stranded at my house with three small children because he couldn't find the clean-out line outside my house.  Jerry from Jay's Plumbing worked with me until the clog was totally cleared, and he installed a new clean-out line.  He is worth his weight in gold.
5	Curt, Jerry and everyone else at Jay's are fantastic. Service is always prompt, clean and done right the first time. We exclusively use Jay's at home and for our business! Thanks Jays!
