3	I stopped here for lunch recently after having to do a site visit for work.  As you might imagine, pizza is their specialty but I didn't notice whether or not they have pizza slices.  They've got an individual build your own pizza though.  They've also got your typical hoagies, gyros, salads, & pastas too.  My ham and cheese hoagie was pretty good and I'm glad they have half hoagies here too.
3	Just moved to the area and tried it for the first time. Not bad, better than a lot of other pizza places around Pittsburgh. The wings were pretty good too. Will definitely try again.
1	I've given Pitta Rella's 4 chances now.  Each was progressively worse.  First I tried their Pizza, bland and dry.  Next wings, small no meat and sauce was not great.  I moved onto a buffalo chicken salad, while it was large, there was so much chicken balls and french fries that it could hardly be classified as a salad at all.  So now I just tried their peperoni rolls.  The Menu reads rolls as plural, but it was just one horseshoe shaped dough with cheese and peperoni stuffed in.  The bread can only be described as sandpaper coded, as the roof of my mouth bares it's scar.  The only reason why I kept trying this place is because my husband LOVES their supreme Italian hoagie.....so it you like lunch meat on a hoagie roll (that is also burnt and sand paper-esqe) then Pittza Rella's is the place for you, enjoy!
4	One of the best pizza's around. I get a pizza every other Friday.
