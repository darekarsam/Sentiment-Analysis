2	Got the plumbing part I needed at what seemed a good price online. However, when I checked out the website gave no indication what the shipping and handling charge was.  I had to call and was told it would be no more than $13.  Part came in 2 days later and shipping charge was $14.73.  I give them credit for having the part at a good base price and shipping promptly but the website is poorly designed and misleading. ie, they give multiple shipping options but only ship UPS!  Will add to post if there are billing problems but care should be used at this site.
5	Plumbers and school districts and churches buy from Brown's Partsmaster. If you are looking for for anything from  a faucet cartridge, Sloan valve rebuild, stainless steel kitchen parts, these guys rock! Not only will they answer your questions, you can often sit next to a plumber who is willing to chime in.
5	Everybody is super friendly and tries to help customers the best they can! The place is always super clean and free coffee is always available in the morning!!!
1	Can't see prices on line and can't get a login for 24 hours what a joke
