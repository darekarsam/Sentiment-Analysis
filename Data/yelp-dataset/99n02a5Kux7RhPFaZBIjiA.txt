1	5points was the listing agent in my recent transaction.  I have emails in which Mr. Wilson promises to stand up to his commitments, but of course he did not.   If you are a buyer, stay the heck away.
5	Michael and his team were awesome and very easy to work with.  I was under a crazy time crunch to get a VERY unique property sold (Small Studio Condo).  The team had me under contract in 27 days and were supportive the whole way through.  Michael knew that I was extremely busy with work and a transfer, and spearheaded a lot of the work and provided only pertinent details as necessary.  He answered questions in a timely manner and was available almost any hour of the day.  He is knowledgeable of the city and it's neighborhoods. He also loves to work with local businesses in the  communities he lists.  For example, at open house, he used a "local" bakery for the broker's open, in order to keep it in the "neighborhood."  Just a great person and team to work with.  Thanks Guys!! Josh
5	I have never worked with a more professional and detail oriented staff then this group. Their experience and expertise made my buying experience one of the most expedient and easiest investments I have ever made. I wholeheartedly recommend 5 points realty!!!!
