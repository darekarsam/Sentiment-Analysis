4	This discovery was made on one of the notorious outings my friends and I make.  On this particular trip I am happy to report I had a great time despite the fact that I was still tired and sore from being repeatedly beaten into the ground by my martial arts instructor just an hour before.  Anyway, back to the restaurant.  It was a very cute little place, with fantastic food.  They have huge portions, and everything has a great flavor to it.  I highly recommend seeing what this place is all about, even if it is a little hard to find.
1	Food was really not that great.The garlic shrimp appetizer, granted, it was good and ample, but the shrimp were overdone and tough.We had two platos, I had a tamarind pork and my husband had shredded beef. Tamarind Pork-It was a huge plate and portion, but the tamarind sauce was way sweet.  Usually, my notion of tamarind is savory.  The side vegetables were alright and the beans were decent.Shredded beef-We both thought it had a funny flavor to it.  Once we literally got in to it, we realized it was green olive flavor, which we both don't like.  Other than that olive flavor, it was okay.Mojito - good, but not great and it was quite small.
4	The service is frequently spotty.  But the food makes this one of my favorite lunch spots in Charlotte
