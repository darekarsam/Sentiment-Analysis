5	Liz provides an intimate and private setting in her warm home for massage therapy.  Her massage room is soothing and comfortable.  She offered me yummy tea and thoroughly asked me about where I felt soreness and needed attention on my body.  I loved the water soundtrack she played while she massaged me.  My favorite were the hot towels she placed on my back and legs.  Her touch is high pressured but gentle and even though I was super tense all over, she made me feel very calm and relax.  I left feeling healed and not sore at all!  I will definitely be using Liz's service again.
5	Liz is a fantastic masseuse! I finished a half marathon yesterday and scheduled a massage with her to help recover and unwind. She was sensitive to my areas of concern, gentle (yet firm!) with her touch and provided a wonderful ambiance! I have a hard time relaxing so during a massage I don't mind a bit of dialogue since my whole body is currently in a jelly-like state.  I truly enjoyed the experience and feel rested and rejuvenated. I will certainly return.
