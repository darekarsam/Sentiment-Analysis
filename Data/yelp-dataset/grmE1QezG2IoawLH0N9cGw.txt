5	Went in to purchase some carne asada ranchera, while talking to the butcher I told him this was for my daughter's birthday.  He then went in the meat locker and brought out a fresh piece of beef and then fresh cut the whole order.  He put the meat and marinade in a bag so everything would be ready to go to the grill.Grilled up the meat and it was great.  Also bought some fresh chorizo, that he just finished making.  It was excellent as well.The place was clean and all food looked well prepared and stored.  Service was excellent and the people working were very friendly.  I would definitely recommend this place to people looking for fresh Mexican style meats.
5	Clean shop, Marinade here is one of the best I've had in town, I've been coming here for almost 4 years and have always been blown away with the quality of meat for carne asada. The guacamole, cream and salsas are top notch too. They carry a large selection of mexican products.Friendly staff. Don't be intimidated if you don't speak Spanish, they usually have bi-lingual people working here.
