5	Had breakfast today at The Mirage. Wisconsin Beer Pancakes. 2 of these over the plate hanging delicious pancakes for only 3.99. The waitress gives you s::: when you order 2 because she can't quite believe you can eat 2 of these. But I showed her it was no problem and had an order of Bacon (4 yummy slices) to go with it. We will  keep this as our high carb breakfast stop for sure!!! Service was great and the wait staff is friendly and outgoing.
3	Stopped here to kill some time after work one day. Always see it but never stopped in. Plus it's snowbird season and I'm not QUITE ready for my aarp card yet. Super clean, bright, a few TVs playing different games. Waitress seemed a little preoccupied even though it wasn't that busy. I didnt eat, she never stopped long enough for me to order anything. I'll have to go back sometime and try the food though.
4	This restaurant always delivers in terms of great food, service and ambiance. On this visit, my lunch party was particularly impressed by the service of our waitress. She was professional, efficient and friendly a wonderful asset to an outstanding restaurant. Well done, Mirage Sports Grill!
5	Bloody Mary and breakfast, Direct TV, what else do you need? Bla bla bla its an American bar oh ya they have horse racing events too.
5	Amazing food! The chicken philly cheese wrap is where it's at! YUMMY!
4	We arrived at 8:30 am on a Friday, and didn't have to wait for a table. By 9am, there was a line up! We enjoyed the omelettes, Nutella Crepes (maybe a tad greasy), corned beef hash, eggs Benny (massive egg yolks cooked to perfection), buttermilk pancakes and spicy Mexican skillet. Service was friendly. go hungry!
