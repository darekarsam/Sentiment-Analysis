5	Sara is the best.  Not only does she really listen and advise, she is an outstanding colorist.  I've had some ideas that won't work well with my hair type and she is always honest.  She keeps me from making bad decisions.   I'm glad she's young because she won't retire for a long time.
5	Crissy did my hair today and I LOVE it!!! She really listened to what I wanted. My cut and color is exactly what I wanted. Thank you Crissy for taking the time and effort with my hair. I'll see you in 6 weeks.
