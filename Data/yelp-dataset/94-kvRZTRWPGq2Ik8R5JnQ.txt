5	Great place to go! Been going for years free balancing and rotation with the tire and rim purchase! 3 yrs later and I STILL get compliments!!
5	Amazing service. I know I was very particular about my car. Took a few days to get things just right but they got the job done with a smile. I totally recommend this place to anyone in need of rims and tires. My #1!!!  Thanks Janet!!
5	Thanks to Mike for an amazing service! The process was easy and fast!! I would recommend them to anyone!!! :-)
1	Do not buy from here!! I bought a set of tires and rims from this place and they claimed to have a warranty. Not even 9 months later all 4 of my sidewalls are cracked! They said they would send them to the manufacturer, but the most they have ever given someone was $120.00 for a credit for all 4 tires. They now want another $600 for more tires. What a rip off!
