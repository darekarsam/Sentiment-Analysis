5	I have been bringing my older Volvo here for about a year now, and I wont take it anywhere else! Jared has been so helpful and honest with things my car needs. I recently moved to California and still come back just to have them work on my car. They are always done when they say they will be, and I can always trust they are going to be honest with me, which is very hard to find!
5	Jared and Paul are amazing.  They are super knowledgable, trustworthy and there is no BS.  I took my high mileage volvo in here to fix a problem the Volvo dealership was supposed to have fixed.  They fixed it and only charged me for gas.  They have earned a loyal customer for life.
