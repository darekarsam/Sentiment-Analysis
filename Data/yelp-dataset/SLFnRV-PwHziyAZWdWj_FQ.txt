4	Whaaat?  No love for Ange Ricky?  I'll have to fix this.My boyfriend and I were a little unsure about the goat tassot, so Ange let us try it before ordering.  It was VERY slightly spicy.  Oh, and delicious.  It sounds a little funky, but it doesn't taste too outlandish.  The chicken was good too, but I was too sold on the goat.I also got her vanilla lemonade.  I ordered it as a slush, which was way too good.  The only problem is that it had very large chunks of ice in it, which made drinking it awkward.  I'd suggest not getting the slush; just keep it simple and get it as a liquid.I didn't like the plantains, though I'm a hard sell on that, since I don't like bananas much.  They were too hard and dry for my tastes.Ange was also extremely sweet and welcoming.  Her personality alone could make this an enjoyable experience.  And just the goat and the lemonade would bring me back here in a heartbeat.  That is, if I didn't live in California.
4	Amazing Haitian food! Have the Caribbean lemonade and the goat. Rice and beans = mmmm. And some of the nicest people you will meet. A great family restaurant and wonderful spot.
