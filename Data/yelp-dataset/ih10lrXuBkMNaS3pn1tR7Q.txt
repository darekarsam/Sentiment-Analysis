5	Steve and Stephen were awesome. They saved me some serious cash belong me avoid a service call and fixed my vacuum navigator for my pool. They really care . You don't realize you are in a chain.
5	This was my first visit to this Leslie's. I was not expecting the outstanding service provided by the store manager Steve, and was pleasantly surprised! He went above and beyond by completely repairing our pool vacuum, while efficiently taking care of every other customer in the store, providing us valuable information, and entertaining us the whole time. The repair was free of charge, and expertly taken care of! We will certainly be regulars at this Leslie's now. Thanks Steve!
