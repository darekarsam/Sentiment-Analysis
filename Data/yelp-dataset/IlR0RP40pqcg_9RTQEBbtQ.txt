4	Not sure if there's really anything special to review about a corner store and a car wash, but I have to say since this place is close to my area, the people who work here are very friendly (and actually say hello to you!) This will sound a little crazy, but there are FREE car vacuums at this location (yes, I said FREE!) and this is why I love this particular Terrible's so much. Other places you have to sacrifice quarters in order to get 10 minutes to vacuum your car, while this one you could clean what you need and then go with no problem. Also, this location isn't mobbed like some of the other ones I've been to.
4	For a drive thru car wash they do a pretty good job and you can't beat FREE vacuums!
5	I get my car washed here and really like the service and especially the professionalism of assistant manager Michael Jorgensen.  He is polite, articulate and has the energy and drive to move forward in his life.  I always enjoy our brief chats!
5	Good carwash. Staff is nice.
3	Just another gas station. Nothing special.The price was quite cheap, so I decided to fill up my tank here.The station is quite dirty (litters all over the place).
2	The name is great. But there was no gas. And it is a gas station. There should be gas.  We just want to go home.
4	My husband and I left Town Square in search of a gas station with a car wash. We drove to about 4 different gas stations before we finally set eyes on the Terrible's at this location. It was definitely a halleluiah moment. We drove up to the car wash pull-through and were quickly greeted by an attendant. We had a gnarly stain on the front of the car and asked the attendant if he though he could get it out. He'd sure try, he said. And they did! Alas, they were not successful but those car wash attendants get an "A" for effort.
