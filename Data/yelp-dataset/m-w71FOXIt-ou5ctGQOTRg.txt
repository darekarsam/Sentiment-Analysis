3	This post office also double-times to sell cards and other stationary-type items, but it feels quite old and event a bit dingy inside. The first time I went, the queue was so long that I had to leave and come back later. When I returned, things were much better and the staff was friendly, but it still wasn't the most amazing customer experience at a post office.
5	Great post office!  The guy that works there is THE BEST!!  USA or UK, he has then all beat!!!
