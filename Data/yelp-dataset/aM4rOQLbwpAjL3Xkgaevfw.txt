4	So...take a wild guest as to what is their specialty? Beef of course! I had moderate expectations for this restaurant but I ended up having a great night at  this family-owned French bistro! The owner was extremely friendly and very proud to describe to us their specialty: Grilled entrecote de boeuf (sorry, I don't know the translation... its a cut of beef!) with a sauce made with 18 secret ingredients served with all you can eat french fries.I ended up having the specialty and my girlfriend chose the beef tartare as she's been having a craving for it for a long time. The owner made sure a few times that we were OK with eating raw meat.Everything was absolutely delicious. My steak was juicy, tender, perfectly cooked and charred. The sauce was really really good as advertised. There must be a good dose of butter, parsley, shallots and white wine. I have no idea for the rest but the sauce truly elevated the flavour of the beef to a whole other level. The fries were delicious as well. But the best was by far the steak tartare: hand chopped as soon as the order comes through, the meat comes topped with a raw egg yolk. You then mix in all the other ingredients to your liking: onions, capers, parsley, mustard, mayo, etc). The beef was absolutely fresh.My girlfriend and I usually share our meals when we eat out. We'll usually swap plates when it's half full. This time however, she kept on raving about how good her tartare was that I kinda felt bad about snatching the plate away from her. I only took a few bites and it was heaven indeed! We both licked our plates clean and that was the end of a delicious meal!A solid 4.5 stars
