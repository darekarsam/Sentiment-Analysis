5	Swimmer insurance has been very helpful in helping my family procure life insurance. They were there every step, from calculating how much coverage my wife and I needed to making sure the policy is with a reputable firm. Excellent one on one personal attention.
5	We've used Swimmer Insurance for our business for years and they have never made us feel like a number.  They give us "concierge" level care and we always receive the time and attention our business needs.  No matter who you communicate with at their office, they are all courteous, knowledgeable and helpful in getting answers to our questions.  They are proactive in getting the best insurance possible for our business and recommend the right blend of coverage without pushing for more than is really necessary.  They save us time and hassles dealing with the insurers and ensure we only have coverage with the most reputable in the business.  Top notch business care and service.
5	I had a wonderful customer experience with Swimmer Insurance Agency.  A human being answers the phone, no long menu to navigate.  Matt Frazier was top notch to work with directly.  He's available and happy to help.  He made insurance easy for me.  Matt is personable, knowledgeable and has integrity.  Matt wants to build a relationship with his clients and if you should have a claim, you'll be glad you have Matt on your side.  I highly recommend this agency for ALL your insurance needs including your business insurance needs!
