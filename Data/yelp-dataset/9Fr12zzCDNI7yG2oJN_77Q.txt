5	Shawn Eric performed at an event at our home and all of our friends and family were quite impressed.  Shawn Eric is engaging, personable, and can cater to any crowd.  I was especially impressed by not only his skills as a magician but the fact that he could cater to my 8 year old daughter, amazing her, and still maintain the older crowd's piqued interest.  Shawn Eric has great communication skills and promptly responds to inquiries and questions.AMAZED!  Already plan to hire him again for future events!!!Thank YOU Shawn Eric!
