4	Bridesmaid dilemma solved!  I was recently a bridesmaid in a wedding where a familiar situation presented itself - LOVE my friend to pieces, do not love...not even a little bit...the dress that my beloved friend selected for me and the other bridesmaids to wear.  After a ridiculously high estimate at a different alterations place, I was in a bit of a time and monetary crunch to find someone to make all kinds of alterations on this dress quickly and with little investment since I knew I would never ever wear it again.I had driven by Kim Alterations countless times so I popped in and explained the situation.  Kim was as shocked as I was about the cinching, shortening, pulling, prodding and pleating (yes - pleating!) that needed to be done to this thing.  While we were conversing, Kim mentioned that she does a lot of alterations for David's Bridal so I had full confidence she would make this dress work (actually, I felt like I hit the bridesmaid dress alterations jackpot with this one!). Even though she was going on vacation the following week, she made all of the necessary changes quickly at a crazy affordable rate.  She should definitely be your go-to woman for bridesmaid dress alterations big and small!
5	For over 17 years, Kim has hemmed, mended, and altered COUNTLESS items for me, always well done and always with a smile! She pays great attention to detail and realy cares about her customers. I trust her with anything and would recommend her to anyone. I won't go anywhere else!
5	I hope that "Kim" is okay - after a car wreck/accident as I have known her for MANY years! We go a long way back, & her husband & I are retired from our U.S. Army. She is without a doubt - the BEST seamstress I have encountered around our planet earth! Best wishes to Kim for her post recovery, & being back in the saddle again - to  perform her seamstress wonders for all of us! Happy New Year ******* Kim!
