5	Quality Italian food in nice surroundings with helpful and efficient staff, nice choice off the menu, and a good example of how to keep regular customers, local and visitors alike. Food is of a high standard with all the regular dishes you might expect from a good Italian restaurant. 'Homely' food, rather than fancy....Owner always seems on hand if any queries or requests. Can be a bit noisy when the place is full - which is often! - but to me thats a sign of a good time being enjoyed! Next door take away also offers carry outs if you fancy a meal at home. Certainly worth a visit!
4	Al Borgo is a lovely, little, family-run Italian restaurant near my Mum's house, because of its locality we go there as a family quite a lot. We are always greeted warmly by the staff and the service is faultless. The menu has all the usual Italian suspects, but they've been doing this for years so they've got the classics down to a tee. This is where I first tried Calamari and it has since become a firm favourite of mine. It's one of those dishes that really does rely on the quality of the ingredients and the skill of the chef; the batter is always light and crispy and the squid is never chewy or rubbery, perfect. If ever you pass by in the evenings, the place is full of happy diners. The people in the west of Edinburgh are very lucky to have this place on their doorstep.
5	Firm favourite.  Menu not overly extensive, good choice, so means food is quality.  Great staff, very friendly, I like that the continue to ask if you need anything, I find in some places they serve food and forget to refill drinks.  They have always found space for us last minute and space for the babies I have had over the years growing into small children.
