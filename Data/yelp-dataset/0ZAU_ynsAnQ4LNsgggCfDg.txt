5	NS nails hasn't had a review yet and I can't imagine why?? These girls are amazing and for Scottsdale the prices are GREAT! I have been to many places over this area and this little shop is the best bang for your buck.  They are a little hard to find but if you know where AZ AIRTIME is you will be right next to their door.  I won't be going anywhere else for a long time. Thanks girls for all the wonderful mani/pedi you have done for me and the cute designs :)
5	This place rocks. They are great for kids but also give high quality mani pedi for not a lot of money. There is a mother and her two daughters who are the primary operators but all the others are great too. They are either slammed busy or can do walk ins. I hope they continue to do well because they are my go to.
1	This was, quite possibly, the worst gel manicure that I have ever received. The technician did a nice job using regular polish for my pedicure, but the gel manicure was horrible. Upon leaving, my first thoughts were to get it fixed immediately at another salon. Also, the technician did not use clean tools. She kept dipping them into a bowl that had other dirty tools soaking in it. I would not recommend this salon for gels at all.
