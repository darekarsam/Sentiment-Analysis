5	Excellent, unpretentious Pan-Asian (mainly Mandarin) restaurant near the heart of Montreal. We arrived by train from NY on Monday evening (Aug. 15, 2011) and ate there with my close friend in Montreal and his two teenage kids (his wife had to attend her friend's birthday party and couldn't join us). Tons of excellent food, friendly and good-humored trilingual (Mandarin, French, English) service, and very reasonable prices. A little hard to find if you're not a local, but well worth it.
5	This place is a hidden gem!  I went there 3 times.  1st time, no one.  2nd time, a couple tables were taken.  Last time, it was almost packed.Great variety of Szechuan and spicy food.  It's cheap and delicious.  The staff (lady) is super friendly and she speaks French, English and Mandarin.One of the best Chinese place in Montreal in my opinion.A must try.
