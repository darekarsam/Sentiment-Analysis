1	Owner came out to repair my Asko dishwasher, ordered & installed an expensive part, didn't fix it. Never came back, won't take my calls. 4 months later I made an appt with his ?wife & he didn't show up & still won't take my calls. Terrible
1	this business is very disrespectful, one of the reps came today and made fun of my wife and took not even 5 mins to fix the problem and wanted to charge her $135 for a clog pipe. and my wife told him not to do anything but he did anyways and wouln't leave till he got his payment. I would never  recommend their business to anyone!!!!! took advantge of a lady. also made fun of my wife telling her "ma'am you couldn't fix this problem yousrelf and laughed at her.
5	I have used them twice and they have been very courteous.
5	We just had Robert ,from the Appliance doctor , to check my Dacor oven. I have NEVER had a repair service clinician so prompt, so polite and courteous ! And, gave me helpful tips on how to use my ovens... He went above and beyond!  Will definitely reccomend to family and friends!
