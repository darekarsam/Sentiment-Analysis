5	I have four pets, three dogs and a cat, and Stacy was awesome.  Our shepherd mix is 15 - 16 years old and had matted hair.  Stacy was very gentle with her, as well as our cranky, old cat who had some matted spots on his coat as well.  The prices are very fair and she does a great job.  Previously, taking our dogs to the groomer was a 1/2 day ordeal because two of our dogs don't like each other and need to be separated.  Awesome experience!
5	The owner of this company is truly a gem.Treats all animals just like they were her own. You cannot get better service anywhere in the valley.
1	I really don't like to give negative reviews, but isn't that what yelp is for? OK, so I called for an appointment got her the first time, she was super nice. We made an appointment, and she never showed. So I called, she was really apologetic, lost my info, it happens, so we reschedule. She arrived on time, I had a meeting so had a friend ask that my little yorkie, not be shaved, and just a straight yorkie cut. The whole appointment took 20 minutes, and yep, my dog was shaved. So short that to be in air conditioning, she has to wear a sweater!! Also this was $60.00, really that's great money for 20 minutes. So the search for the great groomer continues, so disappointing.
2	While she does a great job, she is VERY unreliable. Be prepared for her to show up at least 30 minutes late, if at all, and to constantly reschedule at the last  minute. Again, she does a great job- if you can actually get here there!
