5	My 13yo busted the glass on his Iphone and I brought it here.  1 hour and fixed.  Very good to deal with and fast.  Wish I would have found them sooner.
5	Needed my iPhone repaired (back light went out). Took it in to have it repaired by Sara...she is amazing!! She was working in the office by herself and had a ton of repairs.I told her not to rush with mine and saw how well she treated each customer and repaired their phones (iPads/devices) to perfection. It's hard to find someone who takes pride in their work and is affordable. I drove an hour just to get to this location, and would do it again, to have work done by her.
5	This company is great, I dropped off at 4 pm and was ready the next morning for pick up. No surprise costs added when i picked up which is always a concern as many companies do that to you.I have no hesitation in recommending this company for repairs to IPads screens if needed.
5	AmazingImmediate attention by SarahKnew exactly what was requiredHappy to explain everythingVery passionate and helpfulWorth the extra costReliable service provider for your ever growing smashed up devices... esp the fragile Note 2
