4	I was traveling in Montreal and wanted to see "Little Italy" for some pasta. I don't know French so it was difficult having the menu exclusively in a foreign language. The only downside to the experience was the waiter. He was really rude and said he couldn't help me if I didn't know how to read the menu. I ordered Fettuccine Alfredo and had them add shrimp and clams. It was pretty good but the waiter acted very put out the whole time. The bruschetta was delicious! There were bugs in my wine but I just drank it instead of dealing with "Garson" some more. All-in-all, I think I would go back here given the chance. It was the best of my dining experiences during this trip (the others were very bad).
4	A friend of mine made reservations to the resto as we were looking for some Italian. Came in through the back door and at first was not impressed. This Casa opened up to a nice little restaurant, full house (expected for a Saturday), clean restrooms and great vibe. Our waiter was very bilingual, friendly and did well for our party of 8. I had some of the best gnocchi that I have ever tasted and the rest of my meal was great. I am sure to return.
5	Amazing. Service was stellar, food was even better. This place doesn't look like much from the outside but trust me -- it is worth it. And great prices too.
5	This place is an absolute gem. It features it's own pasta but that's just the beginning. In an effort to save your eyes I will only say GO!!
