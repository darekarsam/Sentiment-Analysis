5	Someone just told me they recently enjoyed the best pizza they ever had in their life at this restaurant
5	Great little place, great SERVICE, good pizza!!! Thin style pizza, good and fresh menu!Pizza is good and consistent every time I go. The service was stellar all the times and that's a big reason why I keep coming back.The first 2 times with 2 different waitresses and last time with the manager when the place was almost empty, late at night. He even allowed us to stay longer without kicking us until he had to, which was way past official closing time.The atmosphere is also much better during the summer when the terrace is open and people are enjoying their meal... great for a first date.For lunch is always full and they don't accept reservation.Price is very reasonable, but when you receive good service I'm always willing to pay a little more.
