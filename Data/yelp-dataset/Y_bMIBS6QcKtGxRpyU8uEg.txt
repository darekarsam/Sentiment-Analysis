4	Can't believe this place has no reviews, someone find a Yelp community manager for Montreal, quickly!Gorgeous huge interior with great coffee selection and baked goods. Coffee shop turns cocktail lounge come evening with a well stoked bar at the back.Free wifi, tonnes of seating and very friendly staff. Interior is done up quite swanky with red and black decor. A few giant wide screen tvs in case you want to catch news highlights.

Second, it's a good brew -  even in francophonia. This just tells me that Montreal craves good coffee from all over.We came into this place to use Le washroom. I was positively giddy at not feeling awkward to just walk in and do that first. Usually I would  buy a coffee so it did not look like that was my ulterior motive.   The place offers an incredibly chill environment  for its modern, dark interior feel.  I feel the low lighting caters to all the laptops utilizing the wi-fi. (I would do it, too but I feel I must have a macbook to blend in).If I lived in that area of Montreal, I could see myself as a frequent visitor.A note before closing. When popping in for your brew, do take a look at the local art on the walls.
