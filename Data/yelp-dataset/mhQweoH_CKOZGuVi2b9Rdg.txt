5	This is my quick stop for busy days. Its filling, they are fast and always give out free samples. The place is clean and its not costly. Of all the fast food chicken chains they have the best biscuits!!!!
1	I love Bojangles, and it is nice to have one close to home, BUT every single time I try to go to this location and either dine in or go through the drive-thru I have received horrible service. For some reason it always seems like they only have 2 people working, the line inside and out is wrapped around the building, and more times than not- the order is incorrect. I will now go out of my way to find a better equipped location to enjoy my chicken.
1	Bojangles has always been our favorite "greasy spoon" for the occasional weekend breakfast when we are feeling too lazy to cook.  Unfortunately, while Bojangles is known throughout the South for their legendary biscuits, the Tega Cay location is better known in my household for their legendary order inaccuracy.  I've been here probably a dozen time, and would posit that my order has put together incorrectly on 75% of those occasions.Today was the final straw.  After having to return to the drive thru window a second time to place a second order for the items that had mysteriously been left off the first, I was lucky enough to get the manager at the window.  When confronted by their mistake and their impressive streak of screwed up orders, she simply shrugged, smiled and said she was sorry and hoped that I had a "nice day."  Ever seen the "buh-bye" airline episode on SNL?  I felt like I just lived it.Too bad.  The biscuits really are amazing.  Lucky for me, there are other locations to choose from... that I will probably be visiting from here forward!
4	This is an older Bojangles. All the great food but a little difficult to get in and out of the parking lot due traffic etc.
