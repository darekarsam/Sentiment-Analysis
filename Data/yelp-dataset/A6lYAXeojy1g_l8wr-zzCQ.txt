2	I have eaten at many Chinese restaurants, and this one was not impressive. They were cold but business friendly.  I asked about an ingredient and they would not add it for an extra cost.  Crab Rangoon is called a "cheese puff" and were ok.  Most of the food lacked seasoning and I felt they were skimpy on ingredients.  Finally, when ever I have ordered a meal with fried rice, it at least had vegetables. So I was disappointed to open my meal and find plain fried rice.  I didn't really feel that there was much heart in the cooking. I will not be revisiting this place. Too bad because its nice inside and clean.
5	I recommend the Cantonese Noodles these are ala Monterey Park, Ca. True authentic Chinese cuisine
5	First time in for lunch. Clean dining room nice staff and generals chicken was really good. Excellent value. Give this a try!
5	OMG amazing! Love this place, always fresh food and the best spring rolls I've ever had in my life lol
5	Amazing! Clean, quiet, and the best Chinese food in town.  I'm always so surprised they don't have more customers.  I think it's because the exterior looks so small and non-descript from the outside.  Once you walk into their dining area the ambiance is impressive.  If you haven't tried it, you should.  The West Valley's best kept secret.
