4	Considering that this place made me laugh tonight, I had to give the old locale a review.It's a great location for me: Perfect for just about to turn onto the highway.  And there is a lesser number of hobos around the front begging you for the various number of things that they do.  I didn't say that there were NO hobos, but there are a lesser amount than some of the convenience stores in the area.  Even the gas prices aren't completely awful.The staff is always nice.  The one guy I regularly see always tells me that I look like the boyfriend of one of his lady friends.  I've never seen a picture, so I can't verify the claim, but the subject invariably comes up every time I come in.  Ah, he's a nice guy.  So whatever.Tonight's moment was me buying one of those Arizona lemonades.  I walked up, ready to pay, and he asked to see my ID."For lemonade", I asked.  I hardly ever get carded these days. A can of lemonade is the last thing I'd expect.He looked surprised.  "It is?"  Then we looked at each other for a moment, and burst out laughing.  "Now I'm wondering if I'm getting more than I was expecting", I said.  I guess he's so used to shilling cans of beer, it just seemed like yet another transaction.  One has to admire his consistency and thoroughness.Nice service, good location, less hobos.  I don't need a lot, but it works for me.
2	The only real reason I find myself in a 7-11 is to get a Slurpee. The other night was no different. Oh yeah, EXCEPT ONLY TWO FLAVORS WERE WORKING AND ONE OF THEM TASTED LIKE GARBAGE AND THE OTHER LIKE CRAP!I am assuming this was an isolated event, so I suppose this grant a double star, but don't let it happen again!
5	Great customer service. They  have alot of different things to eat and snack on. I like the fact they  have healthy snacks and real juice. They  are fairly clean and have lots of options for me to eat
