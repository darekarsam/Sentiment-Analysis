4	We ordered pizza for our daughter. The pizza was hot and tasted fresh. They also thee in free breadsticks because we were the last customers of the day. That was really nice of them!
4	My garlic Parmesan boneless chicken wings were amazing! My pizza came faster than predicted, and hit and buttery! I've lived PH since college. Good stuff!
2	It was on time. That's all the good I can say. The fingers were out of A box and as plain as could be. Kind of like the frozen kids Dino fingers.  The pizza was not cooked all the way. There was no cheese to be seen or tasted for sure. The meatball were from the same brand as those fingers.  Like children's frozen food. I have been getting these flyers for years. I finally decide to try them, and I am so disappointed.   Bummer.
