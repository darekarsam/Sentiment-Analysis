1	After waiting two and a half hours for my food and calling four times the woman I spoke too blamed me for not answering my phone. The reason I did not answer was because they called the wrong number, which they also typed incorrectly on the receipt which the driver showed me while he apologized for the stupidity of his coworkers. The food was horrible. I fed it to my dog.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
4	Delicious cheese steaks made the way you like them.  Cheese fries are sloppy but delicious.  Take out is quick.
1	Currently sitting at 2 (TWO) hours waiting for delivery that I ordered off Grub Hub from here. We got a pizza, wings and a cheesesteak and fries.TWO.HOURS.On a Tuesday evening with no sporting events or other extenuating circumstances going on.On the off chance this is literally the best food I'll ever eat in my entire life, I will never order from here again. They tossed me a 10% discount and said, "I don't know, the delivery guy got stuck in traffic, I honestly couldn't tell you," when I called to ask what the hell was going on.We just got it as I finished that. As I suspected: waxy, microwaved pizza, the worst cheesesteak I've ever had, and soggy, unsalted fries. The fact that they somehow managed not to screw up the wings is a minor miracle entirely overshadowed by how overwhelmingly terrible that food was. Atrocious from beginning to end. Never again.
