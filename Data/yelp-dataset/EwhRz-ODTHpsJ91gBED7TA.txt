4	Get the BBQ Chicken!Just opened today! I was looking for the previous restaurant and was surprised by a new place! Very friendly staff, great BBQ Chicken. I'll be back!!
5	While traveling we stopped by the restaurant for lunch.  The atmosphere was very good and the service was couteous and friendly.  The food is AWESOME!!!  The BBQ had a great smokey flavor and the meat was very tender aka (fall of the bone).  ALL of the side dishes were very very good.  Please try the mac&cheese & yams- you would think your grandmother made them.  The desserts were also good!!  They had to ROLL us out of the place because we were so full.  They next day we went back AGAIN before we left town and also took food to go.  WE WILL DEFINITELY STOP BY ON OUR NEXT VISIT.
5	By far the best catfish I've ever had in any restuarant!
