5	Great experience!  Dr. W was able to get me in right away, ( I think he keeps a certain day open for new patients).  Took care of my allergy problem and today I'm virtually symptom free.  No nonsense approach and will explain in detail what's going on.  Definitely recommend him.
5	I went my entire life with sinus and allergy problems. Moved to Vegas and saw Dr.Weingarten. Ordered a ctscan and showed I had a deviated septum.  Just had surgery and I am already feeling amazing.  Amazing doctor and came highly recommended glad I went to see him. Rosie his coordinator and staff are awesone.
4	Dr Weingarten is my twin daughters ENT.  He is very personable and great with kids.  My girls love him.  He is the only Doctor they run up to and hug every time they see him.  He put tubes in their ears about a year ago and we have been back several times for follow up appointments.  His office gets busy and sometimes there is a bit of a wait.  They have a cool table top video game that keeps the kids and some adults busy.  I definitely recommend him if you are looking for an ENT.
1	Need help right now with an ear ache?  Forget it.  First available appointment is twoweeks.  By then I will have found a cure myself.  thanks
