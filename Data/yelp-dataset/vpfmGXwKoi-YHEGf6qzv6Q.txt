5	I really enjoyed my time at Around the Bend Book.  I met many interesting people and had great conversations. We're new to the area, and this was the perfect opportunity to meet people in the area.  Malcom, the owner, is great!  Stop in and enjoy some good books and good friendships!
5	Great little bookstore.  The staff has always been very nice while I browsed.  You won't find the newest best-seller, but there is a good assortment of used material for fair prices.  An asset to the North Boroughs!
