2	A chippy is a chippy, it's probably more important to Scotland's culture than the annual Haggis Hunt or Glenmorangie whisky. It's a type of food you are guaranteed to get anywhere in Britain but no one takes their chippies as seriously as Scotland.Seeing as more attention to detail should go in to finding a local chippy than finding a local pub, I have to say the Chip Inn falls rather flat for me. Every time I have been in to this chippy I have felt like I'm a burden to the staff that work here. Very little smiles from the staff and little to no interest in chatting which isn't for lack of trying on my part.Good if you're wanting a portion of chips to walk home with after work but as for service, very little is given.
