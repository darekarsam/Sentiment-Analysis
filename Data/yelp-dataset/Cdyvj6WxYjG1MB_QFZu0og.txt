2	Ok I'm in Montreal for a business trip with a co-worker and starving. We find a strip full of restuarants and it 7:00 pm. What the heck to do.Boston Pizza in Montreal, what a oxymoron. The parking lot was crowded for a Tuesday night so it can't be all that bad.I order a Black Angus certified 10 oz Sirloin with garlic toast, veggies and salad. 19.99 canadian. I order it medium rare thinking that it could be tough. It was allright but I needed a A1 sauce or something, what I received was this meatloaf sauce (the kind your mom made.....yucky). Veggies were soggy.I think next time I will try the pizza. For lunch that is. Off to downtown for dinner...
1	Don't be fooled by the name "Boston Pizza" I was homesick for some Boston Pizza -- save your appetite and go to any Regina Pizzeria in the Boston area instead!www.pizzeriaregina.com
2	I came to this restaurant a really long time ago with a couple of friends. The service staff was really really weird. Anyway wont spill much but lets I've had one of the most weirdest serivice from this place. Their drinks were good, since it is mostly a sports bar. I'd say its just great for guys to come hang for a little time out with a beer or two with some live Habs. If youre a girl, Id suggest dont even think about a couples thing in this place as the waitresses are very touchy feely.
3	Dans le genre "bar sportif" la nourriture est tres bien, et la salle a manger est ideale aussi pour les familles. Menu assez vaste mais leurs pizzas et hamburgers sont bons.
1	Very bad experience this time . Pizza not fresh look like reheated very dry . Burger bread Is very cold cheese not melted and dry cold very bad .and service very slow . And unfriendly .
