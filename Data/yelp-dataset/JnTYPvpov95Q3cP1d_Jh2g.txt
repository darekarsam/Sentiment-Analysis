4	24/7 weekdays & long hours on the weekend. Plus if your with a Black Card member it's free. This place leaves little margin for excuses not to get/keep healthy. It's a full blown no brainer & if your not getting busy live'in ... your getting busy die'in
4	This is my 3rd Planet Fitness I have joined.  So glad they opened one in Fort Mill since most of the gyms in town are expensive.  How can you beat $10 a month for new equipment, awesome hours, always clean, friendly staff and a contract you can get out of by just asking.
5	I was a little hesitant going to this place, wasn't to sure about the purple but the front desk staff is very friendly. One thing that really impressed me was how a staff members are always wiping down machines and keeping the place clean. One of the cleanest establishments I have been to. Also I have went at several different times of the day and never had to wait on machines
3	Not 24/7.. Most Planet Fitness gyms are.. But not Fort Mill and Rock Hill. They close at 7 pm Saturdays and Sundays. And 9 on Fridays!...Even though I was told by their associate when I transferred my black card membership from Charlotte that eventually Fort Mill would be 24/7. Nearly a year later they seem to be doing great on memberships and still only 24/4.. Forget working out Friday, Saturday or Sunday nights.
4	Great place to workout, the staff is very friendly and keep the place running like a clock. My only complaint is they are not open 24 hours. I posted photos with operating hours including 2014 holiday hours.
