5	Sehr schneller und freundlicher Service. Zu Preisen und Speisekarte wurde bereits alles gesagt.
5	As an American of German descent, I will never pretend to understand the Germans. But I sure do love German food and when the dollar is low compared to the euro, I like a reasonable meal at a sane price. Service in Germany is not the same as service in the USA, so do not come to Stoevchen for the service.Come for the flammkuchen which is only 3.90 for the classic tarte with sour cream, hamand onion. A side salad is only 2.65, and a Radler is 2.50. It is a student type place but well worth it for Americans who are open minded and not expecting the service they have come to rely on in the  USA. Also, most of the schnitzels are only 4.00. I have given prices in euros.I love this place, and it is open for breakfast, too.Knowing German will make it a bit easier for you to appreciate Stoevchen.
4	Nice place especially during summer to enjoy the inner yard.Cocktails and German classics are part of the menu. Prices are in the average.
5	Bar with a very nice atmosphere. The Flammekuchen are quite nice and cheap. The waiters were always helpful.
