5	Zip-Dang is such a unique store full of awesomeness!  From beautiful skirts and clothing, to cool art and jewelry and much more!  The owner is super nice and you can tell she has a passion for what she does.  I'm so glad there are still independently-owned stores like this around, and everyone should visit Zip-Dang!
5	Always changing, stellar collection of locally made gifts. Their nod to things like the lakes and DCFM is lovely, and the recent addition of a whole line of drink here beer glasses and prints and shirts is pretty stellar. Haven't found any clothing that clicks with be, but there are so many other great gems, including cards, candles, and I'm sure other things that start with C. ;)
