4	Clean and updated McDonald's with the new menu board, serve-yourself soda (Coca-Cola products) and a ketchup dispenser. Yes, they have a drive through as well. As McD's go, I thought that this was a decent one.
4	Newly minted McDonald's. Double drive thru which they actually utilize. You definitely get through the line faster.
5	That service was hot fast and tasty
3	Where do I begin! Some hate it, and some are 'lovin' it', but personally, it's a love-hate relationship.But I can't stick with McD because a steady relationship w/ it not be the best for my body. But again, I love many of their sandwiches. Some criticize it's taste, ingredients, whatever. I think the Big Mac, Quarter Pounders, and even the Cheeseburgers taste good. Yes, I also have an issue with the nuggets but I hear they fixed that problem.The reason I'm not an official fan here is because of the crowd and sanitary conditions in some places. The one I go to is fine though. Anyway, we all know we all go from time to time. So, bottom line, I'm okay with McDs!
