4	I have never shopped at this location and was greeted with friendly staff.  Rhonda, a cashier there helped explain the gas rewards on the Fry's card.  She explained the benefits of having a Fry's card.  Looks like I will be using one. Every $100 in groceries is 10 cents off a gallon and every $500 is 50 cents off a gallon.  I never knew that, in regards to the gas savings.  I buy groceries, so might as well shop Fry's and save on another need I have, gas for my car.
4	This is a nice Fry's. The staff are all very friendly. Avoid going during the day if you want to avoid the old people (nothing against old people, but too many of them and you're gonna have a bad time).
5	I love this location.  Friendly employees of all ages. When we visit my mum in AZ, we bypass the Albertsons and head straight to this Frys. My toddler loves the car shopping cart & the bakery gal always lets her pick her own cookie (a big deal to my kid) & the older gentleman cashier, always gives her a sticker. Parking is ample.  Store is clean. Even the deli guys rock & remember you (and what hair color I had last trip haha) in a big metro city, little things like this...make them my go to Arizona store.
