5	Great costumer service!  Pleasant, courteous, polite!I got a flat driving down from PHX to Tucson this week.  Despite being very busy when I arrived I was greeted by every staff member I encountered, from guys working in the garage to the costumer service reps.  They told me they would be right with me (while I waited for people in front of me) - and they were.  I told them I just needed a tire plugged.  They took a quick look at my SUV and told me it would be 50-60 minutes.  Now, I don't know if that was a real estimate or if they were just keeping my expectations in check.Either way, I was in and out of there in about 25 minutes.  Tire plugged and no charge as my tires were under warranty.  I appreciate who pleasant the staff was, that there was effort wasted to upsell me, and how quick they were!I wish I had got the two gentlemen's names who helped me to give them their due credit.Thanks guys!
5	Stopped in last Saturday to get a couple of tires switched on some wheels for my Jeep. A couple of wheel issues kept them from reinstalling the wheels... and my spare was the original sized tire. They found a used tire that would fit the spare's rim and match my oversized tires... back on the road for the same initially quoted price! That... is how it's done! I will be back for my future tire needs...
5	This location is the best! The guys work so hard for each customer and I know they care about what they do. Their product knowledge is superb!I have bought Four sets of tires from here and they service me like I own the place! Why go anywhere else?
