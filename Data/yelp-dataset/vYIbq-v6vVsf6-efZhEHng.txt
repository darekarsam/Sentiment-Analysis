5	Best tasting protein shakes I've ever had!! Cookie  dough tastes like cookie dough and so on.   They have a lot off differeNt flavors. Teas give me a ton of energy and the classes are  great.  Staff is so friendly and makes shakes to fit each individuals nutritional/fitness needs.

5	LOVE going into Bombshell for shakes or even to take one of the free fitness classes they offer! Eveyone is always so friendly no matter what time of day (tons of energy). I highly suggest stopping in for a meal replacement shake (over 50 different flavor combinations) or take a free fitness class!!!!
