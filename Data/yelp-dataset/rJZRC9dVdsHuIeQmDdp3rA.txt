2	I gave this store only 2 stores for the following reasons:The store looks overall clean, most of the time.The clothes are sometimes neatly folded, but usually a mess.The staff at the MAC cosmetics counter, have no idea what they are doing. They apply makeup very poorly. They cannot even color match foundation. These female MAC staff workers are clueless, so do not ask their opinion or HELP. It is best to go elsewhere for your makeup needs. Because these workers have no clue how to select products properly of a customer. And it is obvious they lack MAC cosmetic training. For instance, in the U.S., a MAC employee must take extensive training courses prior to working at a MAC counter/kiosk and they also attend yearly training to stay updated with the trends and products. Maybe the MAC girls in Germany do, but is obvious they did not pay attention because they do not provide customer satisfaction.
