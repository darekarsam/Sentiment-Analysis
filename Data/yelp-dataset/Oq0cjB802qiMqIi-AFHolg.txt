5	I've been here several times. I was recommended this place by a coworker and have been very happy with the work they do. They have excellent prices and friendly staff. They only take cash, which is kind of a pain, but for a cut, highlights and style it's well under $100, which is excellent. I definitely recommend you ask for Denise M. She's a sweetie and you'll feel like you've known her for years after just a visit or two. I highly recommend this place.
5	Dawn did my hair here and I love it! She listened to how I wanted it cut and colored. I always hear scary stories of how some hair stylist go crazy and do what you didn't want. Not here :]
5	I've been coming here for the past 5 or so years and love it. The girls are always nice and they make you feel extremely comfortable. I definitely recommend getting your hair done by Alma or if you're in need of waxing or a facial, Dee is the gal for you! I sing praises to my patients and friends about them and I hope you give them a try!
5	We have been here several times. It is always clean and everyone is very friendly. Sandra is a master colorist and hairstylist.  Not to mention gives THE BEST scalp massages! I can't imagine anyone else ever touching my hair again! Definitely ask for Sandra!  She is awesome! :-)
1	Walk in on sat. Nobody was up front and nobody helped me. So I walked out. Do not go there.
