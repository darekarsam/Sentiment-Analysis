4	Super selection of teas, including some rare & VERY pricey. You can buy a sampler of 4 teas for about $10.00. If you like the blends, you can always come back and buy whichever  ones you prefer. This place also stocks Queen Mary blend, which I have always had a very difficult time finding. There are 3 little tables for sit down teatime, if they are not already occupied. The place is SMALL, so there is no room for more tables. The owner is very personable & knowledgeable about various teas: blends, origins, etc. and will happily explain and /or recommend a blend based on your stated preferences. Conveniently located on Ave du Parc, look out for their sandwich board outside the store, as they are in the basement and are easy to miss.
3	3.5 StarThe storekeeper here at Marie is really friendly, she offered me a sample of some tea while I was browsing the store. Here you will find good selection of tea and tea wares. And even chocolate that has tea flavour! I ended up picking up a bar of Milk Chocolate with Green Tea & Jasmin from Morocco!There is a few tables that you can order a cup of tea to enjoy.Good for anyone that are into tea or a place to pick up a gift for any tea lovers!
