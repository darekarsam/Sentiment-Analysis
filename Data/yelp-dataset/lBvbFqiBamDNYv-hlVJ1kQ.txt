5	My sister and I enjoyed a two night stay at Clarence Street B&B. We were warmly greeted by Mike and Angela who were extremely accommodating and helpful. The morning breakfast was delicious and prepared exactly when we needed to fit our schedules (including a rather early day). Angela was even kind enough to offer to make me some Haggis with breakfast so could sample the local treat. The room was a decently large size for the price as well as being clean and comfortable. The B&B is a short 20 minutes to Princes Street and the train station, we had no issues finding it. The location is excellent. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it!
5	Had a fantastic time at this B&B while visiting Scotland for the first time. At a great price this it offered a nice sanctuary after a busy day of touring. The owners were friendly and knowledgeable offering good tips and interesting insight into the local area. Tea and Coffee as well as towels and a TV were located in room. The bathroom was clean and breakfast was made to order, honestly what more could you ask for. If I go back to Scotland in the future I'll be sure to stay here again.
