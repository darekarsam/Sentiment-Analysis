4	Yep, this is another location in the cheap and convenient Sushi Shop chain.  Not the best sushi shop, but probably the best Sushi Shop out of the bunch. The food is quick, the price is right, and the service here is about as good as it gets. We're always greeted with a smile by the kids who work here. This is our go-to choice when we're feeling lazy, but as an easy choice it certainly isn't a bad one.Note: This location isn't open on Sundays and closes at 8pm on weekdays.
3	Really inconsistent. I came twice before and the sushi store was closed after 5. What a bummer. But had some good dragon eye the second time round. Not a bad place at all if youre around the block and craving for sushi, if you dont want to travel too long.
4	Fast and delicious.  Prices are good for the area, and they pay good attention to detail if you want to make small changes or order off menu.
2	MASSIVE RIP-OFF!!!! 32 dollars for a tiny box of sushi that wouldn't have fed two people. It's a crappy cheap sushi chain restaurant. Which I wouldn't have minded if they were actually affordable. Don't waste your time and money. Oh, and they're only open till 6.
