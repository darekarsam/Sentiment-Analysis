5	They're treats are AMAZING. The perfect mid-day snack, dessert, treat, anything!
5	Holy Cow, these are the best treats I have eaten. The Caramelized Nut Mix is my favorite but I love the chocolates too. Beautiful packaging makes it a great gift.
5	A friend gave me a gift of Indulgent Confections and now I know why she's my best friend! She knows how much I love dark chocolate and almonds so naturally the Almond and Raspberry Bark was the perfect present to thank me for housesitting. I also love to mix sweet and salty foods so I can't wait to try the Chocolate Caramel Popcorn. Maybe I'll buy some boxes of Indulgent Confections to give my friends next time around!
5	I got to try a bunch of different samples of these and they are awesome. Seriously, do your friends and family a favor and forget the new tie for christmas, get them some of these instead. So far, my favorites are their nut varieties. The cinnamon almonds, the mixed caramelized nuts, the caramelized pecans... they are all amazing. These are better for Arizona as well since they don't melt as quick as chocolate.
