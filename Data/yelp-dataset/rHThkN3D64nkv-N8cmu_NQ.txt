2	Meh. This location's locality and convenience are the only factors holding me back from driving down to the Staple's on Shea. The newly-renovated interior makes things hard to find, the old layout was much easier. Oh, and all of the supplies they sell here are limited. I was looking for my favorite pen, (I'm OCD, I know) which is a general brand, and it wasn't here. Annoying. Staff are apathetic 75% of the time. The other 25% of the time they're loitering or following you to make sure you're not stealing things. Are you kidding me? Oh, and the asshole with the curly hair is well...an asshole. 'Nuff said.
1	Good luck if you need something printed at this store the staff is rude, incompetent, and really just don't care about ANY form of customer service... I was actually told to go to Kinkos if I needed the work done that day.. I needed 40 copies of a document in color..and the manager.. he just stands around with a befuddled look and shrugs his shoulders.. be sure to visit Nicole.. for a unique experience in bitchy attitude and helpfulness.. so special..the only Office Max in Scottsdale with stellar service is the one at Desert Ridge.. I went to 4 of them in one day and this is the only one that could really accommodate their customers!!
4	Love shopping here since it's close to home and on my way to work.  They will price match with local competitor stores, like Staples, Office Depot (now merged with OfficeMax), and even Amazon prices.  Great place and great location!
