5	This Scores is my favorite! The Manager knows me by face here so I can always count on great above and beyond service! ;).This restaurant is impeccable when it comes to cleanliness and every waiter or waiter show by there attentiveness how the like to work here. Tonight is a hot chicken sandwich night with fries and cole slaw which is really good here. They have approx 10 TV's, clear in quality. As at all Scores when you buy a coke come with free refills but you most likely won't have room for a second coke lol.Seated fast and the waitress took my order in mins of me being seated with a smile as wide as can be, very pleasant lady.Food came quickly & hot as usually an experience you can count on at pretty much any Scores toy experiences.Again i love the fact that the utensils are wrapped in a napkin great hygienic feeling to this!If you want a good hardy and affordable chicken meal, Scores rocks it.total bill came to $14.08 tax in tip extra. Considering it is a reasonable healthier choice to a fast food buger trio which comes to almost $9.00 these days I think it so worth it!
