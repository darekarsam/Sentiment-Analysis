3	Easy to get to location...just like every other 7 Eleven, it has everything from drinks to snacks to alcohol. Stopped for gas and an energy drink...no hassle, quick in and out...no complaints!
3	this place can save your life if you've been partying too hard.have a slushy and relax.  it's only 4am.Gas, Coffee, red bull, water, beer, smokes and hotdogs...well lit , clean and restrooms.
5	It's the cleanest 7-Eleven I've been to hands down. The employees were friendly, and there are not any homeless people standing around by the door. (It Might not be important to you, but at other stores it seems as if they encourage them to ask for money).  Overall great store, great selection, friendly staff!
1	Zero stars. (Located on Windmill & LV Blvd.) Simply needed some change for putting air in my tires (at the machine on their property). I was rudely answered by the woman at the counter, who I assume is related to/is the owner, "you have to buy something." Not about to get hustled so I put $20 into the slot machine and cashed out. She inpolitely tosses $20 on the counter. Not sure what the profit margin on the smallest item in the store is. Most likely it's a few cents. Ending business with my neighborhood gas station could possibly cost them hundreds if not thousands lifetime. On the plus side, the lady at Chevron across the street was very nice and accepted my simple request with no problems. Even if gas is a few cents more across the street, I'll take my business there as they deserve it.
