5	Our school uses Bloomers specifically for anytime that we need a bouquet or plant arrangement to bring a smile to a staff member's face.  Recommended by one of our most veteran teachers, Bloomers is seriously dedicated to customer service.  Owner Ron is exceptionally accommodating; he is always able to pull together the most beautiful and affordable arrangements with little descriptions of what we need.  Always so empathetic, Ron and his staff are helpful to ensuring the best possible arrangements and gifts make it to the people at the hardest or happiest moments.  I wouldn't go anywhere else in Las Vegas for flowers or plant arrangements.
4	The prices here are phenomenal, they offer fresh roses at affordable prices. I was looking for a bag of rose pedals and everywhere else was $40 and up.Their service is great, they had everything ready for me to pick up within an hour. I was even a bit short on cash and it wasn't a problem. I was very pleased.
5	Went in and the staff was excellent. Explained the flower arrangements and prices. Mother inlaw was so happy. Win..win..
5	I love this flower shop! The lady was very approachable and nice plus the price is really affordable. Definitely gonna hit the shop to get flowers from my girl whenever I'm in town!
5	My wife and I got married a few days ago, in Vegas, and she wanted to take her wedding bouquet (which she made herself in our hotel room) back home.  We didn't know how to wrap or package it to avoid damage in a carry-on.After checking out a few unhelpful florists in the area, we came to Bloomers.  The gentleman there was very helpful and empathetic, even though we hadn't purchased anything from him.  He gave advise on transporting and saving the flowers (for posterity), wrapped the bouquet, and found a perfect-sized box for it.Five stars for customer service.  This is now our florist whenever we're in Vegas.
