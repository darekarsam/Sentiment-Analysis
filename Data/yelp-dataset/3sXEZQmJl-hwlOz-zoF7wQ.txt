4	I freely admit to sari envy.  Indian women have the best summer clothes! Those breezy pajama dress things, whatever they're called, look so enticingly beautiful and functional and cool--but as an anglo woman, I'd feel stupid putting on somebody else's ethnic costume.  Besides, it seems rude.I'm a fan of this store because they carry pretty, loose-weave cotton outfits that look less ethnic and more Stevie Nicks.  Flowing, colorful, and insanely comfortable in steamy weather.  I'll take it.The prices aren't great, but everything eventually goes on sale.  You've got to work your way around lots of tacky stuff designed to appeal to aging hippies with an expanding waistline.Come to think of it--works for me!
5	I've been shopping here over 25 years and it's one of my favorite places to shop.  If your looking for something a bit different from the run of the mill, they have a great selection of unique, well made, quality clothing.  Some are even made here in the US, which is an added plus!  If you are looking for Walmart prices, don't bother shopping here.   While not expensive, you definitely are paying for a more unique, quality look.  I get very tired of mall shopping as everything ends up looking the same.  You won't run into that problem here.  Unique yet tasteful and fashionable!  I just wish they had more small size items, otherwise it's the prefect place to shop!  Check it out!
5	FYI.... Rupert Cornelius Inc. has moved to 1717 Monroe Street, in Madison, WIThe new location is really a great shopping experience as Monroe Street offers unique shopping! I'm really excited & pleased w/the new place! Parking is also very convenient @ the Public Library's Public Lot...
