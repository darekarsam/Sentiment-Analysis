5	Best f'n Rueben in the city
5	I was pretty excited to find this truck outside of my work fully stocked with all of my favorite sandwiches!  I gave the midwood a try, and fell in love. Not to mention the customer service was great.  My only complaint is its only here on Thursdays!
2	I got a turkey club.  It was like 11.00 and took two guys like 10 minutes to cook it together.  The bacon was good but thats hard to get wrong.  The bread was good, but the lettuce was cooked with the meat and both were warm, soaking wet, and disgusting.  It was kind of like if you microwaved the lettuces on the sandwich.  The turkey was just kinda slimy and not very good at all.  They mayo was fine, but there could have been avocado, and for the money spent this was a rip.  I will say the guys who run the truck are super nice and have great customer service overall....just need to produce more bang for the buck.
5	This truck sells the best NY city style deli sandwiches hands down.The folks parked their truck at Triple C Brewery on a Friday and I was happy they were there.I had a pastrami sandwich that was just perfect. This is the first food truck where I wanted to go back to and try everything on their menu.
4	Best stinking Ruben this side of NY!  Seriously, these guys make great sandwiches.  The corn beef is never fatty and the guy said he actually spends the time to trim it before he cooks it.  It shows with how wonderful the the meat comes out.  Also, their pastrami is damn good if you are in the mood for a Rachel.  The food is spot on, big portions, and just damn good.  Give them a try!
5	Fresh food, great quality, very nice guys and delicious sandwiches!
