3	Pretty decent for a chain, always fast service and order is always correct.  Normally can have pizza to my door in under 30 minutes and the prices are good during their promos.  For me I always choose Papa John's over the others here in Maricopa just because I like their service and normally prefer their pizza.
4	This location works for me. The pies are done quickly and correctly.The staff is upbeat and friendly. I live close by so I always pickup.
1	I ordered a few pizzas from here and got two large two-topping pizzas for a total of 30. Then I called back two hours later to order 3 more and they charged me $60. I called back to ask why and one of the idiots said "oh because you didn't ask for a special deal." I hadn't asked for one the other time I ordered so I didn't see why I had to the second time. Tim is the worst with customer service. His bad attitude and ignorant service make him unworthy. I really hope that this successful business gets rid of wasteful employees such as him.
