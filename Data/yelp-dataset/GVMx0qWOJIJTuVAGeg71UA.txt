3	I'm going back to shopping at Bi-Lo because not only do they offer double coupons-they have Fuel Perks! For every $50 you spend, you get $.05 off a gallon of gas redeemable at a good number of locations in the Charlotte area. That adds up fast along with weekly gas perks specials (i ex spend $10 on Purina products, get $.10 off a gallon). This Bi Lo is a questionable location but it's the closest Bi Lo in the area and surprisingly clean with helpful staff. The po po is patrolling this place like crazy.......in daylight. I kinda want to go at night to see what it's like. It may not have the ambiance of the Teet but it offers cheaper prices which is mighty fine with me.
3	They have great prices very competitive. Store is well organized and has friendly staff. I have not tried any of their hot food or deli but overall the store is pretty decent. Good meat selections and has a small wine selection along with an average beer selection. Nothing wrong with this place I have seen.
4	Just moved to the area and knew we would have very few options for groceries but was pleasantly surprised by this Bi Lo.  Clean and tidy store with an actual deli and bakery area. Decent selection of fresh vegetables including an organic area. There are limited seafood and red meat selections but an overwhelming amount of back fat pork products. Wish the wine selection was better but can't expect miracles from a glorified Winn Dixie. Staff is not friendly, very curt and short with answers.  Especially true of the cashiers. Expect to assist in bagging your groceries as baggers are few.
