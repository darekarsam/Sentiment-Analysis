3	From a distance you'd be hard pressed to tell what these guys make, but as it happens the results are pretty tasty.The two mainstay options seem to be the Grilled Chicken-Bacon sandwich; it's a nice meld of fatty, crispy, fresh and hot, and reasonably large size compared to, say, Winneburger. It's less exciting if the staff is rushed, but it's filling.The real champion is the Pork Belly set. It's essentially a vietnamese style mini-veggie/bean plate with peanut bits, a hint of lime and cilantro, and some astonishing crispy-yet-melting pork belly strips. The best comparison I can give is Popcorn Chicken; each bite is twice as wonderful if you cover it in a nest of the veggies and peanuts. Of course, compared to the sandwich this option is at best half as filling.Clearly, the Super Truck is a success. But it's a once-in-a-while for me. The options are either too rich or too light, so you may want to chase your lunch accordingly.

I had the trio which consisted of pork belly, Mac & Cheese sticks and a fistful of iced tea. When you clamped your chompers into the Cheese stick it rewarded you with a very satisfying crunch... but little else. The cheese coating the mac lacked both flavour and gooey texture.The pork belly, sadly, was overdone to the point of dryness. The meat reminded me of the pork chops that my mom used to overcook when I was a wee superhero so there's an extra half point for the nostalgia factor.The salad upon which rested the unfortunate piggy parts was the highlight of my lunch. I hate when salad is the highlight of my lunch.All in all, not so super. I'd categorize these guys as well-meaning vigilantes, not superheroes. Keep training, guys!
