5	Staff was very friendly and had good conversation! -most importantly I was a walk in. And this was honestly the best hair cut I've ever had and I have been to majority of the good hair salons in Vegas. -best price -best haircut Thanks!
5	Maria has been cutting my hair for over 10 years, she is fun to talk to and the time just flys by. The shop is always clean, smells good and in a great location. Give them try!
5	Love Melanie and have recommended her to family and friends and all have had great experiences. She listens to what you want and makes it happen but is not afraid to make some recommendations. I loved the highlights she did and am glad I found someone I can trust and who is a very sweet nice person  ta boot! I find the rates are very reasonable and the salon is clean and nice.
