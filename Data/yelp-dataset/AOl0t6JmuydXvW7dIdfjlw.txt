5	This is your one-stop shopping choice for, most things, animal companion related.  The choices in foods, treats, toys and accessories are without peer.  The staff, including, Sylvie - the owner are knowledgeable, friendly, always helpful with their tips and recommendations.We've been customers since the store opened - years ago and we can't recommend the store and staff enough.
1	I strongly believe in supporting local business. But, my sister, who is a dear, sweat individual who wouldn't insult and do wrong to anyone, was accused of lying and trying to manipulate a previous transaction, all due to the fact that their salesperson sold her the wrong size item.  I understand there was a misunderstanding, can happen anywhere, right? Oh, did I mention the owner called my sister a liar, brutal !!!  But to scream at her and make my sister cry was beyond comprehensible, just cruel, really. There is never any plausible reason to behave in such a manner. I strongly feel this business should move to a far, far away place, people like her don't deserve to serve our lovely community.
5	This is my store, the only pet store I shop at. I live in Ontario, but work two days in Quebec and I make sure I pick up all my pets needs here. When I lived in Pointe-Claire, Sylvie and her staff constantly go out of their way to make sure you are happy and part of her family. Sylvie does so much for the community and is always their to help. She support many rescue services especially Rosie's. Her honesty and commitment to her store, her staff and her customers is above everyone else. Others only wish to rate as well as her in customer service.
