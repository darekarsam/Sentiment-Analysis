4	They were really helpful in repairs.  And getting information from Sprint (on the phone with corporate).
1	Worst customer service I have ever had. I called on a Sunday lady told me they were closing in five minutes and she continued to put me on hold and never returned to the phone call. I proceeded to purchase a iPad through the sprint customer service line. I would never recommend this location to anybody. I will never call or go to this location in my life. I hope the managers or sprint corporation reads this. NEVER GO HERE.
4	Very helpful and friendly. They helped me with repairs and adding additional lines. I ended up saving money on my bill when I was not expecting to by them suggesting promotions.
