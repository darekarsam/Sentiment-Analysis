5	Love it! Beautiful and clean. If you want it Chris can usually get it for you. Will be back for sure!
5	Came in here the other day to pick a few things up I've been wanting to get. This place is great, Chris really knows what he's talking about, I needed some advice on a few flavors and they are perfect. Very inviting and comfortable, I will be recommending to friends.
5	Went in for the first time today to get set up with my first drip. The guys were very helpful, set me up under a hundred bucks and shared a ton of tips and tricks with me. The place is clean and well organized. I recommend.
5	Great Vapes employees are extremely friendly and fast with great customer service. They have a great selection and a lot of know how. The house juice tastes like a premium craft and all his prices are lower than the competition! Would recommend to a stranger and best friend alike.
