2	Okay let me break it down for you like this; It's Captain D's! They have fish and some chicken. I don't expect a lot from this place. You may find yourself waiting in the drive-thru and being approached by a bum looking for money. When that happens it goes down as such; "hey you got any money?", "uh no" (which they know is a lie because you are buying food), "ah come on man just a dollar", "I don't carry cash" (which is a lie because you do). You then wait for like 20 minutes while the bum watches you hand the cashier a crisp twenty dollar bill. You then make eye contact with the bum and feel ashamed. You can see it in his eyes, the whole "you son of a bitch" look. I usually crack a smile at this point because I'm all like "the joke's on you bum". By the way, what in the hell does the D stand for? Dirty? Delicious? Dangerous? Historians maintain the history has been lost forever. I will just assume it stands for "Captain Don'tcomehereanymore"
1	Very disappointed with the drive through. While the fish was too greasy and the fries were limp, when we got home five minutes later, there were no forks or napkins or tartar sauce or ketchup. What's up with that? I won't be back.
1	Horrible customer service.  The manager was very rude and seam  to not care much  about his establishment or his customers
