5	This Bank has been here for a while now.  They are really big on Customer Service here. I have to really give them an A Plus for that.  When you go in , they offer you Bottled water, coffee and even some days they have cookies!They are quick and very efficent, They always thank you for banking here. That may not seem like a big deal, but i think it is. Plus they really try hard here. There is a drive thru, as well as lots of parking . Nice place, and a good bank.
5	AMAZING service....ALWAYS.  Love going to this branch, you can actually see and hear the teller....no BIG thick glass between you and your money!And they always offer water.
