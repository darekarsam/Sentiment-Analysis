3	Trying to make a name for themselves by being the bar with the smallest carbon footprint in Edinburgh. The seats refurbed from cinemas and restaurants; the bar made from recycled suitcases and the lighting from large cleaned-out sweetie jars (two very cool touches); the walls insulated with salvaged wooden palates.They have screens that play all the most popular sports. They have a big central bar to make the most of that cool, sit-by-the-bar-local feel without getting in other people's way. They have an abundance of seating areas now that they cleaned out the pool tables, fussball and boxing punchbags that graced (read: cluttered) the gone - but not missed - previous incarnation, Rush Bar.Most biasedly they have a card for those that frequented in the EARLY early days, that grants them 25% off all food and drink. Now I haven't sampled their food as yet (a selection of flavoured baked breads which do sound enticing) but when it comes to finding a cheap JD in town.Staff are chatty and laid back, surroundings are just the right amount of dim, and the crowd is studenty yet not in droves, meaning it's quite chilled and subdued enough to enjoy a quiet - but not too quiet - Friday night.Good venue for a chilled one or for prinkies.Yup. I said that. Not sorry.
4	Great for students offering a 25% discount all day every day. Cheap, quality drinks and beer. Food menu limited.
4	Not bad at all! All other places nearby rammed to the gunnels on a Saturday night, this was quiet. I love the recycled stuff, the layout and the decor. We had Macaroni cheese for me and cottage pie for him. Microwaved but not to death. Finished off the night with a drambuie and a vodka at about 8pm but we have had a busy day :-)
