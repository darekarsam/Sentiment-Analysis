5	Very nice. Drive up teller is awesome when I have the Gson. 2 drive up tellers drive up ATM. Makin it easy to get at our $$
3	Slow! Slow! Slow!!! Okay so I usually don't do reviews on banks because I come from banking however this particular location has just got to do way better when it comes to being quick to serve! I walk in today just to only get a new debit card and make a few transactions with the teller that couldn't be done at the ATM! I'm a big fan of the self service options but today's experience reminded me as to why I don't go in the branch! I signed in along with another lady and they had one associate who works at the kiosk in the middle.. Meanwhile there were 3 other associates who could've been helping or if they weren't helping be in the back. One guy who was a personal banker walked back and forth from his desk behind the teller line then back to his desk without greeting those who were waiting in the lobby to be helped, another lady who comes out to ask if anybody needed help with business accounts, then leaves and then another lady who seemed to have been the branch manager who sat and had a personal conversation the whole time while customers sat in the lobby waiting to be helped. Which leaves me to my point that perception is reality.. Be aware of you're surroundings and simply do your job.. Period!
4	The poor drive thru window teller was getting yelled at by the tube customer and still managed to keep her cool and help me with my deposit. Susan was incredibly composed, and did her very best to be patient and polite, despite obviously being flustered. Be kind to these people!
