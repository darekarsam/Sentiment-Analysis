5	Sami was one of the best real estate agents that I've ever worked with.  I had a fantastic experience with her.  I was a little hesitant at first because she is young but she worked harder and better than any other agent I've worked with in the past., and I've worked with quite a few of them.I have to admit, I wanted to see a ton of different houses but she always made time and was happy to show them to me.  I never felt that I was on a time frame to find a house nor did I ever feel pressured to like a house I didn't.   When my husband and I finally found one that we liked and put an offer on it she negotiated really hard to get us the best deal.  When things came back on the inspection that we wanted fixed she went to bat for us again and was able to secure us a deal we were comfortable with.  What impressed us the most is that she didn't stop there.  She was an integral part of us getting our mortgage.  With our permission, she dealt directly with the mortgage  company to make sure they had all of the information they needed and access to the property so we could close as quickly as possible.  She was truly there every step of the way. I'm not usually someone who writes reviews but Sami deserves an excellent review.  We couldn't have been happier and would recommend her without reservation.
5	Sami was an absolute pleasure to work with. She was diligent, thoughtful, knowledgeable, and an active listener. She stayed attentive to both our interests and concerns, and tailored her search around those interests. Though she has not yet attained decades of real estate industry experience, she grew up in the business with family in reality, and her "greenness" is entirely made up by her diligence, attentiveness, and hunger to learn and provide the best possible service to her clients. Do not hesitate to choose Sami; you will thoroughly enjoy working with her!
