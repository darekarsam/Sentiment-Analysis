3	Chinatown Buffet is located in Indian Trail next to Genarros in the same plaza as Walmart. The restaurant is extremely basic as far as the buffet items. However, on a busy work day I do not find this to always be such a bad thing. With that said it makes it very easy to get in and out of there and leave full. For dinner on the other hand, not so much. The great thing about having a smaller buffet as they do is that the food seems to always be fresh.
4	Restaurant has a somewhat small buffet, but does offer an excellent selection. They have the BEST lo mein and fried rice! Not a huge fan of their crab rangoon (a little too much cream cheese) and their egg/spring rolls are just okay. I love their teriyaki chicken, general tso's chicken and their chinese donuts! It's well worth it for just $8 something a person, and you can also order takeout!
1	Inedible noodles, canned fruit, underdone chicken... Avoid this place.
4	Pretty good, even at 2:30 in the afternoon. There were fresh items being brought out to restock the steam tables. The usual staples of such things - beef and brocoli, battered chicken in a lemon sauce, lo mein noodles, fried rice and the like. As well, one bar dedicated to fried stuff, including french fries, onion rings, crab rangoon and spring rolls. I skipped that one.Dessert bar had some fruit and cake that looked like it wasn't worth the effort, but they have to try, right?Full meal, $6.99. $3 tip because the gal kept my water glass filled and cleared dirty plates quickly.I thought it was pretty good. Better than most. I was especially pleased that it was this good between the lunch and dinner crowds.
3	We've taken the family multiple times, it's not bad. No to the wonton soup, the wontons are soggy. The garlicky green beans are awesome & General Tso's chicken is good. We always enjoy it, remember: it's a buffet.
