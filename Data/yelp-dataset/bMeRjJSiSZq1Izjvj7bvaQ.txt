4	Tau is pretty much your one-stop shop for everything green and organic. They have a little bit of everything, from fresh fruits and veggies to cereals, meatless meat, hemp milk and what not. I usually go there when I need supplements, essential oils or alternatives to Western-medecine. I love their self-serve grains distributors and their (small but quality) selection of medecine, juices and tea. Even tough I've described it as a "one-stop shop" I would never recommend doing all your groceries there: it is expensive, really. You will be paying for the privilege of shopping in a strictly labelled "organic" store. There are some similar products you can find for way cheaper at your local Metro (soy milk for example)..With the economic crisis upon us, some beloved employees have disappeared (the situation seems worse on St Denis st. than anywhere else!). The new employees, or the ones remaining, have not wowed me by their expertise although it might just have been this one specific lady on this specific day..Note that you can call them in advance to have something set aside for you!
