5	Went to Dermalase to get touch up hair removal on a Brazilian & armpits I had done 10 years ago. I used to be an Aestitician & Hollywood makeup artist so I am aware of many treatments and products.I felt comfortable with the staff, they were all very nice. I also found everyone to be as professional and comforting as is possible when you have a lazer in your crotch :)They didn't try and upsell me on any unescesary procedures. They were even honest about certain face treatments I had considered for ageing being inappropriate. I asked about fillers and was told Botox ( much cheaper) would give me the results I wanted.Over all can't ask for a better exspirience
5	I love the results of my Micro needling procedure!! I have been getting compliments on how good my skin looks, so happy I know about this procedure and highly recommend this Med Spa, very knowledgeable on what it takes for great looking skin!
4	I purchased a groupon and it was easy to use.  Receptionist as exceptionally pleasant and Aesthetician seemed competent.Update 4 17 2014.   Used the 2nd of 3 devices purchased on groupon.    Results from first session are promising.  Got in and out quickly and very pleasant interaction with service provider.
2	I purchased 3 IPL sessions. As well as the microderm groupon (2 sessions).  I have seen no change to my facial skin at all after having 2 IPL sessions and on microderm session. They have a 24 hour cancellation policy, which turns into a 48 hour policy if you have to re-schedule 24 hours in advance.  I find it very inconvenient that they only provide these sessions one day a week on a Tuesday. If I need to re-schedule I expect my schedule to be accommodated because I am accommodating theirs.  If you do not re-schedule within their 48 hour window you loose that treatment session.  I will not be going back or ever purchasing something from this spa again.
