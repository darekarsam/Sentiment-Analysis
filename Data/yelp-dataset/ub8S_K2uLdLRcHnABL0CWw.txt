5	I cannot say enough great things about Marcia and Cathy. I have been bringing my dog Zoe to Marcia for years, and she is not only amazing at what she does but truly loves what she does and the dogs she cares for. I feel completely at ease leaving Zoe in their capable and loving hands. I promise you will not be disappointed.
5	This was our first time being new to the area and we are very pleased with both the quality of Marcia and Kathy's work on Wrigley and the customer service. They took the initiative to call me and schedule (same day appointment was available) after I filled out the online new customer profile and did a great job of asking what we wanted for his haircut and executed it perfectly, even though he's a stinker when it comes to having his face and nails clipped. We will definitely be back in a couple months and bonus...it's close to home. :)
5	Excellent service and quality, I'm so happy there's a place close to home I can go. I have been going here for a few months now and have been very pleased with the cuts, scheduling, and pricing. I have gone to numerous other places in the Charlotte area and I value usage of technology and communication- both very strong here. They offer Square payments, emailed receipts, and an online portal for scheduling. I have had no issues getting an appointment and even have been able to get same-day visits. Thank you!
