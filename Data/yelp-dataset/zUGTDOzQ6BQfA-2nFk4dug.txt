5	I've done business with Eddie and his team for a few years, and they are fantastic!  They're always on time and very thorough with their jobs.  I definitely recommend them for your house or office!
1	No show. As a busy new mom, I was very excited when my husband scheduled this appointment and hoping if they did a good job, we could use them monthly going forward. After waiting around for an hour, we called and they had "missed" our appointment on the schedule. We planned (wasted) our Saturday around this appointment. We spoke to Eddie and asked for him to add vacuuming drapes in 2 rooms to compensate for the inconvenience and he said they don't provide that service (really, cause it's listed as a service on your website) and didn't offer anything else to make it right. Initially we were going to reschedule (they couldn't reschedule until a week away), but now we're just getting a refund from living social for this offer. Very disappointing!
4	Used Cleanital to clean my carpets on a LivingSocial Deal.  Eddie was on time, professional and did an amazing job.  My carpets were a mess before he arrived.  I plan on working with him more in the future!
