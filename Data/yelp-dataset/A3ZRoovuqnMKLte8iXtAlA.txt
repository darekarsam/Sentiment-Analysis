5	Patrick Hassett is one great person to work with. He is always available to answer my questions and he saved me a ton of money over my previous insurance company. Do yourself a favor and have Patrick give you a quote.
5	Patrick is great. Besides saving me loads of money on my home & auto, he's gone above and beyond when I was selling and purchasing my homes - one was in a flood plain, and trying to get my mortgage company to get the appropriate docs was a nightmare. Patrick handled it all, in record time, and it wasn't even his responsibility.
