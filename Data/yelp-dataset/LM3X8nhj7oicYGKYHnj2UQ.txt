2	I was excited when I found out there was a French bakery in Fountain Hills. While working there the other day, I stopped by to pick up a few pastries. I was pretty disappointed in the croissants and chocolate croissants. They tasted like what you'd get from Safeway. These were not as flakey and yeasty tasting as the good croissants I've eaten. I've made them myself and expected these to be at least as good as my amateur attempts. Not so. I would call the pastries "OK" and would consider going again to try the bread.
5	A tasty treat hidden in a strip mall off of Palisades. Fresh, authentic French bakery--only one in FH! (I'm glad it's good)
4	These are definitely better than Safeway croissants.  The pain au chocolat I had wasn't flaky, but it was still pleasant, right balance of chocolate to pastry.  I'd probably give it 3.5 stars if I could. Nice variety of filled croissants, nice presentation of their baked goods.
