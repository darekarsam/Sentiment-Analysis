4	My work truck is a 1991 Dodge turbo diesel, and Napa is the place to get Dodge parts.  This store is well stocked, reasonably priced, and I have found decent sales here on essentials like motor oil.When you drive an old truck, sometimes it is hard to get parts, but luckily Dodge Cummins run forever, so as long as I keep it maintained it'll run, and Napa is my Dodge parts gettin' spot.Git er done.
1	I called this auto shop to see if they had a part and could help install it and the gentleman on the phone said sure, if they weren't busy.  I made it clear that I would pay for the assistance.  When I got there, I dealt with another gentleman who laughed at me when I asked if they could help me install the part.  If anyone could recommend a female friendly auto place, please pass the suggestion along.  I did not feel like I was helped here at all.
5	Wonderful service, lots of help available for girls like me who have NO CLUE.....import parts without dealership prices are a gift from the heavens!
5	So all of you might be wondering how do these classic cars keep working and looking good for several decades. Wouldn't it be nice to wake up one day and sell your classic car for big bucks at one of these famous Arizona Car Auction places? It could happen. Especially when you go to NAPA Auto Parts. I have this 1983 Mercedes that needed a bulb, but unfortunately the right kind of 4 watt bulb seems to be non existent at some of these other auto part store chains in the valley.I might be too excited for nothing but who wants to take the chance that one of Arizona's finest decides to issue you a ticket for a non working window brake light? Great service by the gentleman working the counter today.
