5	Excellent haircut at a very reasonable price, good location, what more do you need? :-)I went on a Tuesday lunchtime, didn't need to wait, apparently February is a slow month.The lovely lady cut my hair exactly as I had pictured in my head.  Will be back again to get it tidied up in a few weeks. Highly recommended.
