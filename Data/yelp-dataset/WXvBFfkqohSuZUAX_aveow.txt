5	Mint Locker has got to be one of the most convenient services available in Las Vegas. The website is extremely user friendly and the service is entirely accommodating to me and my schedule! Its honestly a wonder something like this didn't exist before! Its SUCH a great idea. Simply drop off when my dry cleaning when its good for me, place the order on my phone, and voila. Done. Goes without saying, but they did an excellent job with my items as well. Affordable and easy, what else can you ask for?
5	Our condo complex just installed a couple lockers from Mint Locker this past week.   I tested it out and had my clothes returned in 1 day.   Everything was dropped into a secure locker and they sent me a text message when it was picked up and when it was returned.   10 shirts, 2 dresses and 2 coats for under $60.   Very impressed and I will be using the service weekly.   They provided a nice clothes bag for all my future orders as well.No more trips to the dry cleaner!
5	We have a mint locker drop off in our building The Newport Lofts Las Vegas. We moved to LV a few months ago and after trying 4 different Dry cleaners we decided to try Mint Lockers they are awesome it is so easy to use and my clothes are back in two days. I don't have to drive anywhere it is so easy. We love Mint Lockers.*****
