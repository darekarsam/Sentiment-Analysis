5	Dr. Lighthall and his staff made my dental visit a great one...and how many times can you really say that about going to the dentist?! My appointment was on time, so there was no waiting around, and the hygenist gave me the gentlest cleaning I've EVER had. Dr. Lighthall was friendly and knowledgable and really took the time to get to know me and my dental issues. I am referring all my friends to him. Best dentist ever!
1	The candle burning in the waiting room about knocked me over please think about your patients in such a small area! My clothes even smelled of it when I left the building. I was not happy about the fact the dentist cleaned my teeth and it was the worst cleaning I have ever had. Just a little scrape here and there and done! If you don't have a hygentist on the day I booked for a cleaning please let me know in advance so I can book a another day when one is in your office. He was not professional at all and continued to sneeze and cough while working in my mouth. Please if you are sick stay home and don't work on patients! Needless to say I will never go back!!
5	I normally don't do reviews but this place honestly deserves it. I have been to many dentists in my life, but none have been as friendly and honest as Dr. Lighthall. I went to him to get a second opinion about my cavities and he gave me an honest answer. Most dentists try to scam you and tell you that you have more problems than you actually do just so they can make more money, but this place is the exact opposite of that. He is very honest and best of all knowledgable about dentistry. Him and his staff are so friendly and treat you like you've been best friends for years, I absolutely love it here! I will never go to another dentist since finding Lighthall Family Dental.
