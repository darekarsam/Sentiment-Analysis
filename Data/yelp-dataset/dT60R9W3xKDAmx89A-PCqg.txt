4	I'm on this new no-caffeine thing. (It's not going very well and I cheat a lot.) But back when I still thought it was a good idea, I found myself at Smoothie King instead of Starbucks one morning before a DMV visit. The lady on the other end of the speaker was brilliantly pleasant for it being the crack of dawn, even when I told her I had a coupon and then didn't know what I wanted at first. I'm not a usual Smoothie King customer, but this was an extremely pleasant one to visit.
4	Good smoothies, Med is really a super large
2	Was given a coupon for shakes and was excited to use them. Order at the drive thru and got to the window the young lady was rude. She told me I couldn't use two coupons. When I asked why she repeated the same thing. I said you didn't tell me why. She first said that she couldn't  do them both on one transaction. I asked if she could ring it separate. She responded with I am going to need you to come out to the front window. There was nothing on coupon that said you couldn't use the drive thru. I won't be back.
