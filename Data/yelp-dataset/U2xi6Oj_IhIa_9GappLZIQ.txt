5	We have been taking our car to the Warner Rd location of Brakes Plus for 4+ years now, and we have always received excellent auto repair service at great prices. Chase and his entire team there are very nice, trustworthy and are very knowledgeable about all aspects of auto repair.They always take time to explain fully what needs to be done and why. Their estimates and the final amount we pay are always spot on.If you are looking for a trustworthy, honest repair shop who will treat you right, take your car here.David and Svetlana
2	I was coaxed to replace the parts I did one year ago, and they did not tell me that they made liquid leaking. However, they finally fixed the problem.
5	I went to brakes plus yesterday for new brakes on both axels and an oil change. The service was outstanding. Chase helped me, and he was great. He explained everything in great detail and helped me to find the best options for my service. The pricing was very fair, the job was performed in a timely fashion, and the quality of the work was great. I had my brakes done at the dealership last time, and I can already tell that the work that I had done yesterday at Brakes Plus is higher in quality.
