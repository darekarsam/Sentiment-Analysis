5	Everything on the menu is fantastic.  Never been disappointed with anything I've ordered. Friendly staff and quick delivery times
1	The first time I ordered from them was great, but after that, overcharged, undercooked, wedgies with almost nothing inside them, forgot ot bring my whole order, 2 hour wait times, made wrong, and got sick. Done with this place.
1	the food was HORRIBLE!  I have ordered before and it was okay.   This time staff didn't know what she was doing, even after putting the manager on, he didn't get it right either.  The food was cold, salad was hot - go figure.  Soup was the ONLY thing that hot and half decent - never again
