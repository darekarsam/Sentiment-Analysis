5	Best cigar selection in Pittsburgh. Their pipe tobacco blends are fantastic, I recommend RLP-6. Great atmosphere!
4	I like to smoke a good cigar. And I like to talk to others who enjoy the same - and especially like to talk to people who KNOW a lot about them and why they are so good. And so it is at Allegheny Smokeworks. Mike is incredibly knowledgeable and has terrific recommendations. His humidor is filled with delights that he can attest to personally. There are the standard, find in every cigar store brands as well as some he gets exclusively. I always find some things I enjoy and never walk out empty handed. There's a small smoking lounge in front of the store which is always filled with aficionados puffing away in a cloud of smoke - which is noticeable as you approach the place from afar. But that's ok, if you are offended by that you'll not likely find yourself anywhere near here. Great place - might be in my top 2-3 favorite cigar stores around.
5	By far the best cigar/ pipe selection  with a lounge in the Pittsburgh area!  Great employees and very knowledgeable as well ! A must to come by too!
5	This has to be the best cigar shop I've been to, with respect to selection, price, and customer experience. Highly knowledgeable staff that are friendly and always willing to offer a similar selection to expand your horizons. Must check them out.
