5	Delicious. We came here for breakfast three days in a row, and with all the great places around, that's saying a lot!! Love the chocolate hazelnut croissant! Also, their lattes are great! Bottom line: Come here, you won't regret it!
4	Sandwiches are pretty good. I had no idea how it would taste and it was an excellent pick to have for lunch! Being that I only speak English it was sort of difficult to communicate with the employees. But they were nice to me. The drink selection is great btw.
4	A nice place for a quick bite.  I was lured in by a sign of my favorite coffee on the wall - Illy (which is apparently not used to make a regular coffee). The Mon Plaisir croissant with ham, cheese and lettuce was tasty. The personnel was courteous. I didn't see any sign of a washroom, but my hotel was around the corner, so I didn't specifically ask where it was.
4	What a great little find near old Montreal. Pleasant and friendly staff ( who also speak English) and great ambience. Their breakfast is fresh made and ample. Excellent coffee too! There are awesome sandwiches and other tasty pastries to take along as you tour the old city. I'd highly recommend this place!.
