5	I've been going to Patty for a few years now and her work is top notch. I have strayed away by purchasing groupons closer to me but am always disappointed. I've found that each of my massages are compared to Patty's and because of that, they all are a let down in comparison. Her knowledge about what my body is doing and where the tension is coming from is incredible. The ambiance is relaxing and professional (unlike many of the groupons I've gone to.) Even though I have 'cheated' on her from time to time I always find myself going back.
5	Patty is amazing! I've been looking for a well rounded massage therapist that can carry the workload of both relaxing and deep tissue therapy! If you're an athlete and looking for someone to ensure you can give it 100% everyday without fear of injury than Patty will get you there!
5	Patty is incredibly professional and understands trigger point and deep tissue massages. Her services are tailored towards your needs. I've been a competitive athlete most of my younger days and her ability to get the deep knots and kinks out are amazing. I highly recommend her as she's thorough and ensures the customer obtains the best massage possible. The service was for Patty's Ultimate Sports Massage.
