5	I tell you what , They have great pizzas with the pepperoni on top
1	Poor customer service. The people there are lazy. They forgot my napkins and didn't put cheese on my side when I clearly told them that I needed it. The manager didn't do anything for me I am never coming back there again
1	this subway has the worst night shift in anthem. they are extremely rude and absolutely hate their jobs. i will be calling the mgr in the morning to verbally complain as well.
