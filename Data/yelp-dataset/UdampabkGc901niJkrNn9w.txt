5	I have used Graeme for many years now and his help is invaluable. No problem appears to be insurmountable to him within any aspect of our business requirements. He has supplied us with new computers and a laptop over the years, advising which would be best for our requirements, all at a very reasonable cost.He is also a delight to have in the house when we have a home visit, in a nut shell I don't know what I would do without him.I cannot recommend him highly enough.
