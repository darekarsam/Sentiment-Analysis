2	The dentist was very nice, but the dental hygienist was more concerned about her lunch than my teeth cleaning. I won't be going back.
1	I went to this dds. We were passing through vegas. He was very nice but a crook!!   I got an estimate of $4388 but if I bought a discount plan he was selling the price would be $3291. I ended up going to another dds that a friend recommended and found out that Dr Holm lied about me having a big cavity under a crown I had. Said after he filled it then the old crown would not fit back so I would need new one with build up. Cost $1582 not including the filling!!  I went for his X-rays & cleaning special for $59. The receptionist is not friendly at all, the only good thing was the very nice hygienist but She needs to work for an honest dentist. STAY AWAY FROM HERE or at least get a second opinion. I only gave one star cause no zero stars.
1	Just an FYI the $59 for new patients is ONLY for people without insurance. It will not save you "insurance dollars" as their receptionist states below. They also conveniently "forgot" to do the $1 teeth whitening for me.. I will not be going back.PS The Blonde dental hygienist is very sweet! I wish she worked in a better office.
5	My family and I have been with this dentist office for many years. They always make me feel as comfortable as possible. Whenever i have an emergency they get me in very quickly, most times the same day I call. Charlie is always my hygienist. She does a spectacular job which makes me always request her for my next visit. I have had a few different dentists in here. None of which have really done a bad job. The equipment is constantly being updated, not sure if that matters to anyone but i always notice! I would recommend them to anyone!
