4	This is really an excellent hotel. The staff are very friendly, the rooms and common areas clean. The rooms themselves are a bit basic, which was a bit disappointing after seeing how nice the common areas were, but they have all that you really need. The breakfast is good, and has good choices for your tastes - a good cross between Continental (breads, etc.) and full breakfast with bacon, eggs, pancakes, etc. The fruit was tasty and fresh. I had dinner once and it was very, very good, with friendly service.Internet in the rooms is wireless, fast and free...those three words are amazing! The TVs in the room are great, but they could use a few more channel choices. Beds are comfortable, and the windows in the rooms open so you can grab some fresh air, which is always appreciated. Only negative is parking - $12/day. Otherwise, it's a great hotel!
5	As the others have said, this is not your average Hilton Garden Inn.  Excellent service, a great restaurant, and...  something else.  From the statue of Shiva enshrined in the lobby to the daily "Good News" letter delivered with your paper - there are a host of details I have never seen before.  A plate with my name written in chocolate and two delicious truffles greeted me on check-in, and personalized robe and slippers appeared the second night.  Amazing!I stayed 5 nights and had free parking - not sure how many nights it takes to get that....also, don't miss their house brand of spring water, Alkalize - it's been energized with positive thoughts and a Hindu mantra!  ; )
