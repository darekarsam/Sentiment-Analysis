3	Came here for breakfast and got soup which had a large amount of pepper in it, which made the broth almost crunchy....overlooking that, the potatoes and leaks in it were great and perfectly cooked. My friend got a sandwich with a fried potato (or something of that nature) in it and she said it was good as well--but a lot smaller than we thought it was going to be.
