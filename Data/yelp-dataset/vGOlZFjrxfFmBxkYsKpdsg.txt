4	Having been in here a lot over the last few years, it was nice to finally make a purchase that made up for all my free ogling of their goods.Said purchase was a lust-have item that I had seen sometime last year in the window....a fantastic set of army-style drawers that makes a fantastic industrial chic statement in our lovely 'new' loungeroom.  It also makes for wonderfully practical storage that looks amazing.This was just one of the larger possiblities from this store, though....they have an array of odds n ends, little pieces for decoration or larger items, like lighting, mirrors, ladders, smaller cabinets etc.  I really like some of their wrought iron pieces, and love their nautical stuff, which I'll no doubt be plundering once I'm done fixing up our boxroom...!Overall, there are some items that are quite inexpensive and others that are really quite expensive.  It depends what you're looking for.  The staff, however, are very helpful and genuinely pleased when their favourite items go to a good home!It's well worth a stop if you're looking for something a bit more unique, or something for the more traditional 'male' gift, or interesting things for your home.
