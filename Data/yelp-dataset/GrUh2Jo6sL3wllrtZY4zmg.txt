3	Chinese All you can eat buffet restaurant offers a variety of Asian dishes. Look for beef with broccoli, egg rolls, lo mein, orange chicken, shrimp, soup and more. Menu items vary. I am sure this place will be rated down and that is too bad. For what it is, it is not all that bad. The ambiance is worse than bad. It looks like the owners have decided to open a thrift store in the lobby and it has spilled over into the dining room. The food is mediocre at best, but for $5.25 all you can eat it, it is a good value. The food tastes fine, typical of "Mall" Chinese food. Give it a shot. You may like it. Just don't expect much other than decent food and fairly good service.
1	scary, unless you are homeless. stay away. disgusting, unsanitary, hole in the wall.manager is a crazy lady who yells at you and watches you to make sure you dont take any food home.tables sticky, bathroom is similar to ones you find at a truck stop, pealing paint and unkept.  carpet has holes in it and appears noone has cleaned it in a while.

3	= = = = = = CLOSED = = = = = =After having enjoyed this nice 3-Star place which we regulars called "Eastern Buffet & Tacky Swapmeet" for over two years, I was sad to come up here today & find them gone.     :-(For a similar place nearby I went to New China Buffet today, & enjoyed it.  They're at 2939 N 24th St.
