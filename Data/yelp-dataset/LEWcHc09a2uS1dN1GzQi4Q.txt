5	I been a client of Dr. Larsen and staff at Shea Chiropratic for nearly 13 years.  They have done wonders for my back and neck, and their treatment plans are reasonable and affordable.  Most insurance is accepted, and they will often work with you if you need help with payment options.  State of the art services, yet friendly and homey atmosphere.  If you need a good adjustment, consider Shea Chiropractic Clinic, PC at 32nd and Shea Blvd. in Phoenix (just off the 51).
5	Dr. Larsen is wonderful! He is extremely professional and a wonderful Dr! I would highly suggest him!
5	This is not your assembly line come back 10 times a week because I want to milk you  for all your money chiro. Dr. Larson listens and adjusts accordingly
5	Dr Larson at Shea Chiropractic can really get you straightened out with a minimal amount of visits. I was referred to Shea Chiro over 5 years ago by an associate. I am so glad to have such a great place in our neighborhood. I know people that drive all the way from Goodyear to use there services.
5	Glad to see so many people feel the same about Dr. Larson. My husband and I have been going to him for years, for regular "maintenance".
5	I can't speak highly enough of the personal care you receive from Dr. Larson. He always greets you with a smile and takes the time to hear your concerns. I've had a few sports related injuries that my trainers struggled with fixing that Dr. Larson fixed within a few visits with his methods. He is a very active Doctor and I feel that's part of why he really understands the problems we go through as athletes. I drive 40 miles across town to see him, that's how much I believe in his methods. Do yourself a favor and give him a try, you won't be disappointed!
