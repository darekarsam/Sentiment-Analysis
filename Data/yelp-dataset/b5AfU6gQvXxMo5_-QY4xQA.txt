5	My kids love this place. Dr. Waggoner is wonderful. The best part is that they are almost always on time.
5	Have been going to see Dr Waggoner for years. I've been to the Sahara location as well as the location on Simmons in North Las Vegas. The staff in both offices are friendly and helpful. The offices are set up similarly so the transition was easy on my kids. Dr Waggoner is very professional but has a great way with the kids. Mine are all about brushing well so Dr Waggoner will be proud of them. Evidently I don't rate high enough.  I'm just glad they like him and the service he provides is exceptional!
5	Took my 2 year old for his first dental appointment today and had a great all around experience. The staff is friendly and professional. Liz was our hygienist and she was wonderful with my son. She made him feel comfortable and had no trouble with him being scared. The dentist was also good with my son and friendly. They took a picture of him to capture his first visit and printed it for us, he was also given stickers and coins to cash in for treasure :-) The waiting area has video games and toys. They also have a tv room where kids can sit and watch cartoons. I was definitely pleased with the service and will return.
1	Carey the lady who answered my call was definitely helpful with her sarcastic answers to my question given that they just came back from lunch hr. Thank you for giving me much information with my insurance questions.
