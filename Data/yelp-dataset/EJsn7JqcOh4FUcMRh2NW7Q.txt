3	Very friendly and helpful staff. The ease of getting into this location can be a bit difficult. Due to the shape of the property and the flow of traffic they have blocked off the parking area from the drive through area. On a busy day it makes it a little more difficult to get your deposits ready.
5	BB&T Indian Trail along with all the other Union County Branches offered Free shredding of important business papers this morning.  When I was in the branch earlier this week the manager, John Killman told me about it, and when I informed him I probably had a truck load he told me to come on, so I did this morning and was welcomed with open arms quite literally since he and several other bank employees were on hand to assist.  This is not the first time BB&T has reached out to my business, they did about 18 months ago when Janet Graham, their commercial loan offiicer called upon us offering unbelievable mortgage rates for refinancing our two notes.  Yes, it's true what they say, you can tell they want your business!  Way to go BB&T.
1	Very bad customer service!!!!! Just went to deposit a check and I didn't have a pen to sign the back of my check. So I hit the call button on the drive thru to ask for a pen, and the lady asked me "WHAT DO I NEED"??? WOW!! Everytime I go to this paticular branch I am treated very rudely.
