2	Within walking distance from my family's place - I find myself at this corner convenience store whenever I want something quick and easy. I have to admit, it's an interesting mix of people that make up both the clientele and the staff there. I hope that's a nice enough way of saying that there may be some elements that may entice you to skip over this place and go elsewhere. I've never been physically involved in altercations here however I have seen a few in my time. I can say that the pumps offer Shell gas and that the pumps are usually in working order.
1	Disrespectful! Thrifty Ice Cream customers do not get any respect at this store. You have to tell the clerk to wear gloves.  One clerk coughed over my ice cream (I refused to buy it) and tonight I was next in line but the clerk decided to let somebody at the register get cigs.  Not right girlie.  I will find another store in town with Thrifty's Ice Cream before I go back there.
