4	Very efficient and friendly staff.  We were in and out on no time. Our car was very clean and ready when we arrived.
3	Convenient location on site and easy walk to the rental vehicles.  Efficiient staff at check in and very friendly staff at return lot.  Really appreciate the greeting on the pick up lot with a bottle of cold water on a hot day.  My car wasn't as clean as some I've previously rented.
4	We had a good experience over all. Our only issue was the gas charge. For the first time I paid for the full tank of gas through Enterprise at a rate of 3.28 per gallon. they added $68 for the gas. When we filled the car up while using it, the tank only took 12 gallons. So after I researched the car we found out it only had a 15.8 gallon tank. We were overcharged for the gas. However when we returned the car and we mentioned this the gentleman quickly gave us a refund.
