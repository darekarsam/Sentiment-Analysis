4	great tuna and salmon tempura sashimi! and they deliver!
5	This is about as perfect as sushi can get for me.Very close to where i live.Very web friendly with nice pics of almost every item with a description. Pretty good prices for pretty large portions with extra rolls when you spend $10, $20, etc.Best part is the great selection, friendly workers there and amazing sushi rolls.  Never an issue in more than a dozen trips there. The food is truly mind blowing, just close your eyes and pick at random and you will be pleased.I hope I don't jinx this place, but they used to be empty whenever I would pass by, but i guess word gets around, as they are now much busier and now have a second location. Their new menu is very classy and they even gave a canvas bag the last time I picked up with their logo.The place is tiny though, maybe 15 seats, and yet not really the intimate type because of the large corner windows. More of a friends/co-workers kind of place.
3	I decided to try out tora sushi for takeout today and I felt like I was cheating on my regular to-go sushi place, Nippon. I ordered the lady in red, salmon tartar maki, sushi salmon and the crispy scallop sushi. The website was beautiful and the interactive layout was so well presented that I thought I would be in for a great experience. Unfortunately, the eel was a bit fishy (ha ha I know, it's fish, but the taste was too strong) and the salmon was bland and water-washy. It tasted like soba sushi to me, and I am not a fan of soba sushi.The tartar maki however, was the best and I think that's why I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 2.. It had strawberries and the combination of tastes worked really well.. The sauces were...... All the same. I couldn't distinguish between them due to the extensive amount of mayonnaise in both. I can't describe the taste of the fish because it wasn't necessarily bad, but the quality was not up to par.
