5	I was waddling in between classes at Shine Alternative Fitness and needed something to ease the pain inflicted upon me. No alcohol was in sight, but Zero Gravitea had the two next best drinks. Any of their smoothies are worth a try. Even though they listed three kinds, Larry was just pumping whatever popped into his head. It was all delicious, so a shot in the dark does not sound that bad.Next on my sampling adventure was their loose leaf teas. Nelson already lists them all. My favorite were the fruit infused ones. They all taste fantastic and mixed well with one another. My whole day was a great success with a winning combination of exercise and refreshment. Instead of passing out in a corner, I was given the energy to push on. I didn't even cry when I had to wake up the next morning.
5	What a great add to Shine Fitness.  Awesome, healthy and delicious treats, owned and operated by a great staff, friendly and thoughtful people.
