4	Panda is good.
1	What has happened? Hopefully not all Panda expresses have reduced their packaging and portion sizes. This store has though. The rice was also pasty and overcooked. I was very disappointed. You guessed it, the prices have not changed either for the better. Won't be back to this location.
1	Awful customer service. They were so rude I had to walk out. Didn't seem very interested in serving me at all. I felt like I was bothering them.
