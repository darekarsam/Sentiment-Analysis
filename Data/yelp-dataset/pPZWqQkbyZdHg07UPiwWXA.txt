5	I have contacted Norman numerous of times about real estate advice and he makes time to respond to my inquiries. Norman is very knowledgeable in real estate. He has years of experiences and If he doesn't know the answer to your question he will find out the answers and get back to you with the answer. It is hard to find a trustworthy agent now-a-days who's not in it for themselves. Give Norman a call and you won't regret it!

5	Norman Zheng is a wonderful realtor who is honest, caring, and takes the time to answer the questions, or finds the answers for us.My wife and I feel so blessed to have had Norman as our buyer's agent.  Our 9-day escrow closed ON-TIME, which is totally a credit to Norman.  Even though the entire process was sometimes unpredictable and scary, it was made right, thanks to Norman's persistence, patience, and passion for taking care of his clients.  When the wife is happy, the family is happy!  We've closed escrow for over a week now, and our family is very happy today with our home purchase!
