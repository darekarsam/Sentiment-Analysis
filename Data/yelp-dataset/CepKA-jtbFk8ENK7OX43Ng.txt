1	Terrible service. Dudes are distracted. Some hokey system about tracking repairs that they "guarantee". (Keep your receipt on you forever) or it's not traceable. My screen was cracked.  Not a complicated issue. Never fit very well, then it started freezing all the time Guy basically told me to pay again.   Waste of time.  So much competition out there. Try harder.
5	This Shop Great! First of all, The girl who commented and only gave 1 star,, what the heck! This is a paperless society! nobody wants paper receipts, 2nd of all, I have had GREAT SERVICE HERE!  I have referred and sent several people I know to Talk n Fix. If you ever want to talk to the owner you can, his name is Kevin. I found him to be very Reliable and Ethical business man. Anyone looking at reviews, don't judge on just one, do your own due diligence, stop in and see for yourself.  I gave Talk n Fix my email. That works for me. I can print my receipt and have it at any time. As far as my repair,, Fabulous! Thank You guys at Talk N Fix!Sandy S.
5	These guys are awesome!! Always help me out when I need it and extremely friendly. Big shout out to Gabriel, worked wonders for me even on his first day. Thank you!
