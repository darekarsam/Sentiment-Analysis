5	This place has become my steady morning routine since I came to Montreal. They make fantastic crepes and a good espresso. Pretty decent Wi-Fi connection, too.Try the spinach, egg and cheese crepe!
3	We got strawberry banana and chicken spinach ones. It's good but nothing special. Maybe chicken can be more well cooked...  Good idea to cook in front of everybody walking outside.  Average.
5	This place was our staple when we visited Montreal. We tried the Ham and Cheese, Strawberry and Banana and Raspberry crepes on different occasions and loved all of them. The presentation was superb.They were also the only place that was willing to make iced tea for us. As Iced Tea is not common around Montreal (except in Starbucks), this shows their service is superb.
5	I loved this place and I can't believe it was just by accident that I discovered it. I was walking by on St Catherine's last night and saw a guy making crepes in a window. I thought to myself, this is a place to go for breakfast tomorrow and that's what I did today. For less than $11, I got a giant coffee and a huge spinach and egg crepe. I arrived at 8am and there were hardly any customers. I was surprised and then concerned but not for long. Service was fast and polite, and the crepe was perfect! I plan to come back tomorrow and try a crepe from their sweet menu-strawberries and dark chocolate. Mmm!
