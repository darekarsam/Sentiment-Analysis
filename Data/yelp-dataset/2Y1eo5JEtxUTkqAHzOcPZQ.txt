4	I made an appt for a mani and pedi after a recommendation from my neighbor. Her toes had the cutest designs on them and she told me about this place. I had a pedicure and got a cool design of my own on my piggies :)Then I had a gel manicure. Its a regular manicure but then they use a special gel nail polish which will last about 2-3 weeks. Bonus! My nails look great and I am a happy customer. You can add a tip on a credit card purchase, however, cash tips are preferred.
4	I have been to this salon many times and am always pleased with the results.  Some of the techs are more careful than others (I like Huong, Tan, and Lisa).  I keep going back for the beatutiful designs that they do on all 10 toes.  It will set you back a bit at $15 extra for the design but for a special occasion is completely worth it.  I am always being complemented on my nails and will continue to use this salon.I highly recommend making an appointment as well because they are typically pretty busy.
1	I gave them 1 star cause I have to do it ti write this review, to start I just want to say please do not ever go to this place I mean not only is poor customer service but poor quality omg I can't even think on anything else but worst nail job I have ever had in my life, I can't understand how ppl like this is still in business, this place should be closed down I can see now why some ppl post in here saying they got an infection by getting a pedicure with that been said go at your risk at the end of all is your nails. I do recommend a different place were they fix the awful job they did  TIFFANYS NAIL SALON at  29th and Dunlap they do and amazing job and made my nails look beautiful again.
