1	Worst service EVER! Watch out for Bianco she will snap at you every chance she gets. She needs someone to teach her the basics of customer service!!  Run!! Stay away!  Other staff was pleasant.
4	The almond croissant was far better than average. Combine the coffee with the croissant for a little bit of heaven. All at a reasonable price.
1	I saw a Dunkin Donuts worker carrying a tray of donuts.  When she tilted the tray and lost a donut, she picked it up and put it back on the tray and took it to serve to people in the casino.  Not only nasty but potentially a definite health risk!  Never touch a donut there again.  I gave one star because the app would not allow zero.
