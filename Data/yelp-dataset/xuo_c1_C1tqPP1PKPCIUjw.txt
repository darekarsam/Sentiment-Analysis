4	My family and stay here while passing through Wisconsin, and this is a very family-friendly hotel.  There are several family suites with a dining area, king bed, and separate room for the kids... all at a pretty moderate price.  The pool area has a separate splash-pad for the kids, which is unique to hotels in the price range.  The rooms are clean and the breakfast was the quality one would expect from Country Inn and Suites.
4	Fantastic family hotel at a great price! I love that a full breakfast is included. Kids loved the waffle maker. The staff at this hotel have been extra-friendly. They even called my room after check-in to make sure we were happy. Nice touch. Fun indoor kids pool - we played in here for hours and loved it. Highly recommended family hotel.
4	Always courteous staff, clean rooms, comfy beds, excellent breakfast and pool area. Good value stay. Always my first choice to stay in this part of Madison.
2	My wife's family lives in Madison and we visit from Houston every other year.  We have stayed at this hotel 4-5 times now with good experiences and were their the week of July 13-19, 2014, but something has changed either with management or staff or both.  There were relatively minor issues that were not handled very well and made our overall stay unenjoyable.  Our refrigerator was missing the door shelf so we couldn't store enough cold drinks for a family of four, they upgraded televisions and disabled the use of any of the inputs, so using a gaming system or watching a movie on a portable DVD player is no longer permitted (we found a workaround for that ourselves) and apparently they don't clean rooms after 10 am.  We like the cleanliness of the hotel and the indoor pool is great, especially in the winter, so it's always been our go-to place to stay, but we will be looking for another hotel.  These issues above are all minor but the way the staff handled each of them led us to believe they had little concern for our experience during our stay.
