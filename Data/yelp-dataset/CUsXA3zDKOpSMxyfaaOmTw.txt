3	New Sun Prairie location.Expected a little more fanfare for grand opening but there really wasn't anything.No opening deals, fun, nada.On top of that they forgot to take our pizza to our table.Still. Rocky's has a place in my heart having had lots of memories eating at the other stores.:/
5	Rocky's pizza isn't always consistent from one location to the next.  We tried out this new location last night and we had the best Rocky's pizza ever!
1	Ordered a large pizza as a take out.  It looked great except when we got home we realized the bottom crust was not baked.  It tasted bad.  I tried to bake it longer in my oven, but it still gave us a stomach ache.  Even though our first experience here was good, not sure if we will be back.  I just never feel very welcome here and I haven't heard good things from others regarding the quality of the food.
