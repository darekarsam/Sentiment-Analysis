5	I've almost crawled over to this chinese take away at the most indecent hours, wallowing in self-pity and starvation! Situated just next to student pub Crags, it was just a three minute walk from my university residence and conveniently stayed open much later than many other take-out restaurants!The man who's been behind the counter is quite friendly, but moreso to my friend than he with me.. I wonder what I did! After tasting the most delicious meal off a friend, I realized (????) doesn't a pretty identical version, of shredded fried chicken with honey and chili; extremely indulgent and unhealthily sweet, but gets my vote everytime! New Garden Grove is quite cheap as well, so will definitely not break the bank.
3	Seriously...5 stars for this place?? It's not too bad but definitely not worth 5 when you have Hong's to go to, or at least Karen Wong's down the road. Yes I will agree it is cheap as f**k, and foung outside the Crags and across the road from Pollock this is probably what keeps them in business as the food is pretty bland.Refreshingly not doused in grease, the food still lacks flavour. It is bang average, and whilst perfectly acceptable after a session in the pub, isn't going to be a revelation to your palate. Sometimes when I've had it, the noodles have been pretty hard too, which is never a good thing.Yes it is really cheap, but you get what you pay for and I'd prefer to shell out a little more for much better food. Save this for a drunken purchase, as you're only going to be disappointed otherwise
