5	Greeted in German by one of the owners (the one with the Thick German accent) I think he said Good Morning.Huge Sandwich entitled "160 West" (this place is on Hwy 160, West of I-77).  So Huge my glasses got in it and my jaw was challenged to handle that first bite! Thick Fresh Mozzarella, Tomatoes, Vinaigrette, Beef Cervelat and Pepper coated Salami.  Very good!  Giant sandwich for $4.99No tables though if you want to eat here there is a bar area with stools on two walls!
5	INCREDIBLE! Great quality and selection. I cannot pronounce most of it but it is all great.
5	This is a GEM!  Tucked away in a shopping center, most people would drive by without even considering going inside.  What a mistake! This is a great place to get your traditional and authentic German foods.  They have a deli case full of German meats as well as some foods that are difficult to procure at a standard grocery store.They offer a traditional dish each and every day in addition to their standard lunch menu consisting of various sandwiches.  The owners are their daily and offer great customer service as well as friendly advice on the various products that they have to offer.  By far the BEST value for the food that you get!
5	This place is fantastic!  The owners are incredibly friendly and welcoming and the food makes you feel like you are in Germany!  I HIGHLY recommend checking this place out!!  Try the 160 West Sandwich!
5	I hope this place is around for a long time to come.  The meats are fantastic and the owners friendly.   They were closed for awhile but we are so glad that they are back!
