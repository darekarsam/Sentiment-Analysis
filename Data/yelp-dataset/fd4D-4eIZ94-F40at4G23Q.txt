4	During my little job search on and around Princes' Street, I ended up at M Butterfly, which is very much unlike any of the other shops in the area.As the name suggests, it's aimed at lovers of pink such as myself and and a lot of the clothes are extremely feminine! Quality wise however, I'm not too convinced. It's the kind of store I like to describe as "ghetto fabulous" meaning lots of girly colours, things that shine at you, and occasionally spell something at you. To be fair to M Butterfly though, I would have to head back and properly examine the clothes, because I feel l wouldn't have discovered it if I wasn't looking for a job (it's too far down Princes Street for my liking).
