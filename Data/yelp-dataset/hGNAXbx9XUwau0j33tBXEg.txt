4	Einstein Brothers is the perfect option for those mornings when you forgot to eat breakfast at home but really need a coffee and a bagel to nosh on when you get to work. I stick to my favorite order: chai latter and toasted plain bagel with veggie cream cheese. There is often a line on weekday mornings, but they're pretty fast there.
4	Better than Brueggers, which explains the lines, but it's a great place to get a good bagel. I prefer Brueggers for lunch, but Einstein Bros. has great bagels for breakfast, and their coffee is excellent. The customer service is always pretty quick and considerate as well. I like the Everything Bagel, but make sure you've got gum!
3	I agree with Joy: Einstein Bros is better and, as a result, more crowded than Bruegger's, with good reason: they have better bagels and better coffee. Indeed, if it's a light breakfast I'm after, I'm coming to this Einstein Bros, which is both conveniently located on South, right near Uptown. If you're looking for lunch, definitely head to Bruegger's or nearby Sub Station. If, however, you're looking for an even better bagel option (in terms of sandwiches), continue down South to Owen's. You'll love it. This particular Einstein's is really clean and pretty well-run, even when it's crowded, so you're never too unhappy waiting in line. And like I said earlier, the coffee is well worth it.
4	Yet another place where the parking can be tricky, but Einstein is a good place to grab a bagel.  The place is relatively small and you might feel like you're in the way while waiting for your food.It's set up like many bagel shops, a line on one end, order, move through and pay.I had a bagel with egg, spinach, mushroom and cheese and it was really delicious.  I've also had their regular bagels with cream cheese.  It moves fast, but can be a bit cramped.All in all, a pretty solid choice for people who are used to Noah's or Western Bagel.
5	I love Einstein Bagels!! (Don't be fooled by Einstein's in airports though...they may have the name, but definitely not the quality.) Anyway, as others have said, the parking is tricky, but there are spaces behind the building. My favorite bagel is one of their gourmet bagels, spinach florentine. Delicious! It was well worth feeling like I was in people's way. If it's a nice day, there are chairs and tables in the front. However, if you want a little more space and not feel crowded, take it to go.I grabbed my bagel, juice, and coffee to go and went to Latta Park. It was a great way to start the day!
5	The best Einstein's period.  I travel a significant amount for work and have never had better service at a coffee place.  Really outstanding!
4	Einstein Bagels... carby yummy goodness... This is one of those places you really need to throttle back. They have every pastry, bagel and muffin you can imagine. My favorite choices are the breakfast bagel options; egg white, spinach, mushroom bagel and the Turkey sausage and Swiss. They have fresh fruit cups which are a good choice for your waste line but you know your bootie craves the pastries. For me, the smell is a bit overwhelming when you walk in the door so I like to eat outside. Yes... to all that said the place is crowded and the parking is tight but it is worth the wait. It is still quick and relatively inexpensive to other options in town.  Enjoy!
3	I thought the service at this location was really good, but their 3 star rating comes mostly from the stressed feeling I got while I was there due to the large crowd on a Sunday morning.  I was expecting to be able to run in and grab what I needed quickly, but my visit turned into a big fiasco as soon as I pulled into the parking lot.  This place was packed!  I spent 5 minutes trying to avoid smashing into the other cars that were trying to make their way in or out of the lot.  Once I got in the building there were a ton of people standing in line which was a bit of a turn off.  The workers were very efficient and the line moved quickly, but it was still a little too busy for my taste.  I did like that they have quite a variety of bagels to choose from, and of course they have plenty of yummy-looking pastry treats to choose from as well.If they're not so busy next time I come here there's a good chance I'll bump their rating up.
1	Nasty. Overrated. Threw the crap out ASAP!P.S. As I was asking the server a question, I could see her saliva fall onto my bagel. One side of the bagel was over-burnt for both pieces.
4	Lookin' for a bagel on the run? How about a dozen bagels and schmear for the office? This Einstein's has you covered. While Einstein's isn't my favorite bagel joint in Charlotte, it certainly fills the void - especially when you need fresh bagels in bulk. The service here is pretty fantastic - the staff are friendly, quick and helpful. This is key, especially when you're grumpy at 7 am on a Saturday morning.My personal favorite bagel schmear combo is a whole wheat bagel toasted with honey almond cream cheese. Delightful and filling. I definitely have a bit of a bagel belly after finishing that monstrosity. Plus, they have pretty tasty sandwiches and smoothies for those wanting a bit more substance to your meal besides a carbo load. As the other reviewers have mentioned, this place can get pretty crowded in the am work rush and on weekends. Don't forget to check out the dog bagels near the cash registers - my dog loooves them.
4	Charlotte has a real lack of bagel shops.  Those we do have are primarily chains.  Lucky for us, though Einstein is a chain, they've got the bagel thing nailed and their location is great.Right on the edge between Dilworth and South End, this small shop has a mix of outdoor tables and indoor seating options- bar, big table, little table, etc.  The front counter is filled with the day's bagel selections and the folks behind are busily making sandwiches and filling other orders.  Don't see the bagel you want?  Make sure you ask, because they are usually baking in the back and can tell you how long it will be till the next piping hot batch comes out.  The ordering system has recently been greatly improved here.  Order at one end of the counter and then pick up and pay at the other end.  No more trying to decipher your order form a hand written ticket or having you repeat to the cashier what you have- it's all electronic now, and that seems to speed things along.My wife really likes the bagel bites here- a cup filled with little bagel holes, usually with a flavor.  Cinnamon sugar seems to be the favorite.  They also had pumpkin for fall.One thing I am not a fan for are the bagel thin sandwiches- I just find the actual bagel thin to be just as thin on taste and flavor.  Guess I just need that chewy carby goodness to satisfy?  I am a fan of their coffees, though.  They do have a full espresso station, but I really like their coffee blends- especially the fall harvest blend.  They keep timers on top so no pot sits longer than a hour, that makes sure your cup is fresh- nice touch.  My only gripe with drinks is the woefully small beverage station.  Coffee mixers, tops, and the soda machine all share the counter-space.  The result is no more than 1 person at a time can really be there- get's crowded too easily and the last thing you want is your hot coffee sloshing around in your hands as you make way for others to squeeze in.  Despite this, I can't deny the goodness that is an Einstein bagel with schmear- or a bagel breakfast sandwich with a cup of great coffee to match.  Quick and easy on the weekdays, with plenty of room for longer stays on the weekend.  I say- on the whole- well done!
1	Horrible, horrible customer service. I called to place an order for the next day and the guy hung up. Called back, and he asked me if I was joking. Seriously? I just wanted some bagels! Anywho, went in to get a sandwich a few weeks later, and the onion bagel was toasted to the point of being burnt (couldn't get the taste out of my mouth for hours!). I ended up throwing it away after 2 bites. The manager asked me why I would waste it, not even ask if something was wrong. Not a big fan of their veggie 'shmear', it's pretty bland.
3	Most of the time Ive had good experiences at Einstein for breakfast. I am from NY therefore so...you guessed it...I love my bagels. Recently I received a coupon in my email for $3 off a sandwich at Einstein. So i rolled in for lunch and was greeted by an extremely friendly  staff member (possibly a manager?). Ive never been complimented on my nail polish by a guy, but hey I don't judge- he was nice. I went with the BLT+ Avocado sandwich. It was the only one with avocado so I had to have it. When I asked about subbing turkey I was told that there was another sandwich with turkey (but without avocado) so I just went with the BLT. I received a side of potato salad and a soda all for a little over $3 with my coupon- score!The person who handed me my order initially forgot my potato salad (and the guys before me).  Overall I was in and out within 10 minutes or so. The sandwich itself was a huge disappointment. The bacon didn't seem real - very strange texture and was super oily (blot it please : ) ). The flavor itself wasn't even bacon-y...I can't explain it  The tomatoes were meely -yuck. The avocado was good but overall nothing stood out about it. I would have been ticked if I paid full price because it wasn't particularly tasty and sort of small. The thin bagel it was served on, was bland and not enjoyable- wish I could have opted for a regular everything bagel to add a little flavor. The potato salad was just ok.I don't think I would get another sandwich here. I'll combine this experience with my other regular bagel breakfasts and give it 3 stars.
2	Meh, indeed. I've tried giving this place a second chance...several times. It has nothing to do with the product, this is a chain after all and a bagel is a bagel (right?), but with the service. It can get insanely busy, which is not surprising...but I've been here several times where there hasn't been a line out the door and I am the first in line. Yet the service is slow. Grandma driving slow. On my last trip (with emphasis on the last), it took 10 minutes to get a bagel with cream cheese.I find this surprising, seeing as though there are generally a million people working here. What they are all doing behind the counter, I'm not quite sure. Never again.
4	Just like every other Einsteins - yes, it's busy in the mornings, yes, it's packed almost all day on the weekends, and yes, most of the employees are under 21. Plus, as the menu has evolved over the years to include more cooked items without really expanding the tool set (or room) to do so - your egg sandwich might take a little bit longer to get to you. (but the employees seem to be churning them out as fast as they can)That being said, the pound of smear (regular or low-fat) on your freshly toasted bagel still tastes pretty darn good, and at least this location entertains you with people watching as you wait that extra minute or two for your name to be called. I'm also a fan of the bagel thins - and the egg white/sausage/salsa option is tasty. Plus, you can't go wrong with lox and red onions.Decent variety of fresh coffees (they're always changing at least one out while I'm there), really nice employees (I know I wasn't the friendliest 17 year old at 7am), and as Shauna H mentioned, a manager who always strikes up a conversation about the oddest things. Which is fine with me, I usually leave with a smile on my face because of it.
3	I don't know what it is about any Charlotte Einsteins location that makes them mess up my order but it happens.....every.....frickin.....time. But I'm saying they are A-OK thanks to the cashier complimenting my eyes. Compliments are the way to my heart (along with food) and will make me forgive you for giving me a regular bagel instead of a bagel thin. Plus they have a pretty sweet patio area and coffee that is hot--I'm talking scalding hot but don't but the balm on it kinda hot! You would have to pay me a few hundred to go here on a weekend though because that's when the Stepford wives of Dilworth are there. The spike in my blood pressure  when having to deal with them or their badly behaved children isn't worth it.Be sure to look through your mail, they are forever sending out coupons!
3	I'm very sad to say that quality has gone down significantly. While the bagels are still tasty, they're starting to skimp on the schmear. Back in the day, I remember there was so much schmear, I had to scrape some off, but today my bagel wasn't even fully covered. Although, if you don't mind going back up and asking for more, they are happy to accommodate. In addition, the coffee is starting to taste more like gas station quality...you know, as if the coffee tins aren't washed well and the bottom has been burnt. The employees are quick and greet with a smile. They made my order correct and I didn't have to wait long. But I didn't see anyone cleaning the tables or sit down bar...so many tables had to have been wiped by the customers. Well, I've loved Einstein's for over a decade...but they sure have changed in that time. I will go back because I eyed a new flavor (sourdough), but it may take me a while...
4	Great food, helpful staff, nice location.
4	Had a chance to go back to Einsten Bros this morning for the first time in a while, and I was very pleased with my overall experience.  Highlights:**Bacon,egg and cheese sandwich was good.  Bagel I ordered was extremely fresh and soft. **Banana-Nut muffin was good.  Taste as if it was freshly made.**Order was correct**Though crowded inside, didn't have to wait long to place my order.  Lowlights:**Parking very tight on Sunday mornings**Can be crowded - little seating sometimes on weekendsWhat else is there to say?  Its a Bagel place, and a pretty darn good one, I might add.  Just be weary of what time of day you go there, if you don't like crowds.
2	Einstein's Bagels are pretty poor in general, so perhaps its unfair to rate this particular location so lowly, you say? Not so fast...Found myself killing time between meetings here 2 years ago, and ordered the bagel that made me famous in some out of the way places -- everything bagel, butter, tomato.  That's it. A simple order, provided the tomatoes aren't green, under-ripe and miserable, which they have been at this location often. So I ask, "hey, I'd like this creepy bagel order I get everytime I'm here, but not if the tomatoes are miserable and white/green. Can you please check, and if they are, please don't serve them to me. Despite how they are universally beloved, I don't particularly like white, veiny, hard tomatoes."She acknowledged my request, and when I was handed my bagel, I figured it meant that they were ripe. Not only weren't they, they were almost pure white winter tomatoes and sliced extra thick. I mean... really?This might seem like a small thing, but I asked, and I was served the exact thing I requested to not be served. I haven't been back since, and I spit twice when I pass it.I take bagels (way too) seriously...
3	good bagels, good service, great location, coffee average, wait - not longgood place if you're craving for a bagel or bagel sandwich
3	I enjoy coming to Einstein Bagels, whether it's for breakfast or lunch.The staff here are so-so, nothing extraordinary about their service.  Sometimes they're friendly & quick, other times not so much. Additionally, it's been super clean inside sometimes & another visit it's messy.Pros: Bagels on bagels on bagels! Such a wide variety. As others mentioned, get a box to go for meetings.  Their coffee is really good, whether it's their standard "darn good coffee" or their speciality hot or cold beverages.  Their bagels are HUGE, not skimpy. Specialty sandwiches for breakfast or lunch/dinner. Bagel doggie treats for your dog. Outside seating.Cons: Small space inside. VERY little parking.
3	I like this place, I don't love it but it's decent.It is a short walk from my apartment and many weekend morning I wake up and walk over for a bagel and iced coffee.  The iced coffee is mediocre at best, not Dunkin Donuts quality.  But the bagels are the best!My favorite is Spinach Florentine with plain cream cheese toasted.  They always go a little wild with the cream cheese and I have to scrape some off but that's just how I like things, no mistake on their part.  Asiago Cheese is also a favorite.  When I went this past Saturday around noon they were out of Spinach Florentine so therefore a star is deducted.  I haven't had a bagel sandwich yet but I've been told by many people they are great!There is room to sit inside or outside or just take your bagel and go!
2	I know this isn't New York, but I can't help but feel that Einstein could be a little better per their hype.Maybe it's the 'chain' thing or maybe it's just my taste for a fresher bagel, but Einstein to me is not nearly as good as their compeition.  With Owen's Bagels and Deli down the street and Bruegger's just down East Blvd, this is a distant third place.  I will say that the toppings of the Everything Bagel hold good strong flavors.  Beyond that, they didn't have much size or that bit of thick doughiness that we all love in a bagel.  The staff was extremely friendly though so it wasn't a bad experience by any means.  I just know I can get a better bagel within a mile radius.
3	First and foremost the people that work here are always so nice.  Between that and the vanilla hazelnut coffee it's what keeps me coming back.  Food wise the pretzel bagel is awesome and their bagel thin breakfast sandwiches are good.  Wish they had fresh squeezed OJ cause the concentrate that they have (but put in their own cups) isn't so good.
2	I love the bagel. Not those bagelheads you'll see if you watch a recent episode of Taboo on National Geographic, mind you - those are a little odd, even for me. But the everyday bagel. Even the one out of the cart on the street of NYC works just fine, thanks.There are a few options around Charlotte that do a decent job. But there are a couple that just do strange things with bagels. One of those is Einstein. It isn't that the bagel is bad, it's just that it tastes strange. I think it is too much carraway on the everything bagel - but something is just off.Other bagels are decent, and the place itself is neat - what looks like an old gas station. Staff is courteous, but not friendly, and service is on the slow side for a bagel shop. You typically have to wait to get it, rather than getting it as you are paying. Still, it'll do in a pinch.
3	I'm not really a fan of bagels, but I gotta say the everything bagel with cream cheese was really good. I'd go back.
3	I got the Club Mex and potato salad. It was tasty, but maybe a bit small for the price.  Service was reasonably quick.  I'll go back.
3	I came here for the first time this past Sunday. A little price-y though. Tables were dirty too. Workers are great though. My sandwich was ok. Not much to rant about.
3	Ok, ok, my good friend and fellow Yelper Jeff S. told me, "you are always checking in at Einstein Bros."  Those check-ins have earned me my "Duchess" status at the Ballantyne location.  I stopped at this location near my work because I didn't have the time to grab breakfast on my way in from Ballantyne.  Although I got the same great quality food, I found this location lacking.  No drive-thru, cramped parking, and dark and dingy inside. I understand this Southend location is in an older building, but it still lacks "curb appeal."Service though, was friendly as ever, and if I need another EBB fix in this hood, I would certainly stop in again.
1	This place used to be great, but since the change from corporate to franchise they have changed the staff.  Owens Bagels or 7th Street Deli are much better!
4	I usually go to the Ballantyne location but stopped by a couple of weeks ago on my way to the Panther game with my kids. I got Breakfast Bagel...they got different bagels with cream cheese and the best part I got one of them FREE by Joining their Text Club. Get a FREE Bagel w/ CC, Join EBB VIP Text Club!

2	I ventured out to Einstein's to try something different for breakfast. I ordered an egg, spinach, and cheese on a whole wheat bagel with coffee.  I love the fact that this place offers healthy options however the food was very bland and overpriced 7 bucks for what I ordered is way too much.....
3	This place is ok for a quick breakfast on the run. We came here on Saturday morning before heading out of town. I just got a skinny toasted wheat bagel with cream cheese. Nothing special, really. The bagels were just ok. The service was extremely fast! Though, when we left, my husband and I were discussing how we feel like the staff there just don't really give a crap. He eventually chalked it up to the fact that (since we got there around 10), it was close to the end of their shift.......Not exactly my favorite bagel shop in town, but it is convenient to my apartment and offers a better alternative than a nasty fast food breakfast!
3	This place is convenient. It's the best thing you can say. The bagels are small and soft and the breakfast sandwiches are of the prepared microwave variety. The coffee is good and the service is fast and pleasant. I'll take a better bagel from Bagel Bin if I have the time but sometimes I don't.
4	The bagels are really fresh!  I wouldn't suggest coming here with a dog and expecting to have a table outside available. People who eat at this location are very snotty and could care less about you needing to eat outside with your dog.  There have been times we sat in our car with the dog to eat. The service is good but strange how you order at one station and pay at another.  That seems to be a waste of time and resources.  The building was an old gas station so there are random parking spots at the front door under the shelter. Seating inside is extremely limited so be prepared!  Do everyone a favor, and leave your kids at home!  Too small of a space for them to be running around and screaming.
4	Very nice lunch spot . Fresh food and drinks and nice staff . I will return in the near future and strongly recommend.
3	Ok, so bagels are awesome!!!  The location is in the heart of a happening place. But there are a few things that are no pleasant about this location.  The first thing is parking.  It is cramped and cars are allowed to park under the shelter where prime seating could be placed.  Second, the seating is dog friendly outside, but they are normally full of people who don't have dogs and could care less about wanting to give up their seat to a person with a pet who cannot eat inside.  Lastly, the flow of not paying the person you order the food from is ridiculous and redundant.  A lot of payroll is wasted on this setup and too many people in the food preparation area causes a mess every time.  I would love to like this location more, but for now it needs improvement.
3	I like the bagels here. Today's experience was disappointing though as I bought a fruit cup for my 2 year old and had to return it because the strawberries were old and gross. We grabbed a new one and found a hairy moldy grape (and the other fruit tasted off which explained why my son wouldn't eat it). It had today's date on both cups but clearly they were using old fruit.
1	I had the misfortune of going to this Einstein Bagels this past weekend.  As I bit into my bagel sandwich I realized that something about the texture just wasn't right.  That was because there was a long brown hair wrapped up in the turkey and avocado.  Disgusting!  The staff promptly made me another sandwich which I choked down while trying to not think about the hair (fortunately, it wasn't a short and curly) that I had nearly just ingested.  As I opened the fruit cup the first thing I noticed was a fury grape.  Yeah, the "fresh fruit" had mold on it.  The strawberries were old and nasty.  Needless to say, I threw the fruit out.  The quality of the food here is absolutely unacceptable.  I will never eat here again.
