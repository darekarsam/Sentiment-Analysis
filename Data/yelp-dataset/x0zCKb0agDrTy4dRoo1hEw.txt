3	Sounds like Christine K,'s Review is very personal and not impartial. I have had work done a Wolberts and found nothing wrong with the  service.
5	Excellent service. The staff are very honest with you! I went there first time when I scratched the bumper of my 6 month old car and I was all freaked out and almost in tears. The person that quoted me for the paint job told me "You know it is going to stay just like that for 10 years even if you don't "fix" it, right?" A week later, I got over the scratch and decided not to get the bumper painted. I appreciate that honesty! I did go back there to get my annual inspection and got excellent service again!
5	I have nothing bad to say about Wolbert Auto Body! As someone who knows nothing about cars or car repairs, I must admit that a visit to an auto body shop is full of comments making me feel like I'm a total idiot. They were very nice, did not make me feel like I had no idea what was going on, and were incredibly easy to work with. They also had a great relationship with Enterprise and made the process of renting a car simple and stress free.My insurance covered most repairs, but from what I could see, everything was pretty fairly priced. I highly recommend them for any car needs ... I will definitely be using them in the future!
5	I recently had my car repaired at Wolbert's.  I had some deep scratches, dents and a major crunch in the front end.  They did a fantastic 'bang up' job, and my car looks brand new!  If I could give them ten stars, I would.  I highly recommend them!!
5	These guys (& gals!) are the best! Very professional and knowledgeable. I would highly recommend!
