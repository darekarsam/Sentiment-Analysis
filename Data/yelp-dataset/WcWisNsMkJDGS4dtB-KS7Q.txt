3	Rooney is a pricey yet, stylish boutique offering cool fashion for both genders. I love their selection of Barbour jackets, Gitman shirts and Alden footwear. Somethings are a little ridiculous like $160 for a pair of shorts. There are cheaper ones however, but still...Service is only okay, I would expect a store with this price point to offer perhaps a little more friendly service. At least paying at the till was fast.Take advantage of their sales that happen once in awhile to offset the high pricetags here!
