4	I was immediately checked in and then seated with a beer in one hand and an iPad in the other and having a chat with the lovely owner; a great start. The 'shop' is a very clean, stylish and comfortable place. My hair was done by Laura, who with little explanation, knew what I wanted and gave me a perfect cut without any fuss. Leaving with my hair probably looking better than it's ever done.Having tried quite a few, I can say that Ruffians is definitely a notch above other barbers in town and at a very reasonable price as well! Until now, i've never really found a 'go to' place for a haircut but I'm very glad to say I finally have!
5	Great service, great staff, great haircut. After my first visit I can find nothing to complain about at all. Relaxed, proffesional, skilled and service minded.
