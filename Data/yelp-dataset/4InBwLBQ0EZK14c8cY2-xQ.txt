5	I brought my family here to cool off.  I was pleasantly surprised with the fresh ingredients and generous servings.  The wait time was just right,  considering that every dessert was made from scratch.  I'd come here more often if it wasn't so far from my home.
4	new to me!!!! but it's kinda great. shaved ice...with whole fruit soaked till it's syrupy and then loaded into a cup with the shaved ice. you can add all kinds of stuff to it...i chose condensed milk (because i've had something like it before, so i wanted to be somewhat "in the know"). it is sweet and cold and hit the spot after working in the yard all day. there are all kinds of options here. luckily the staff wasn't too busy so i spent the time asking them "what is that? what is that? what is that?" and they were more than happy to explain it to me. another refreshing treat from our neighbors to the south. they do have the standard fruit and cream and some delicious looking granola, fruit, and yogurt snacks as well!
5	Hand made fruit toppings, wonderful service and the yummy Mexican corn. This place is awesome and very conveniently located.
4	Stopped in on a Sunday night. Place is very clean. The family running shop were very friendly. I got the Bionico which was massive! Lots of everything - fruit variety, coconut, granola, cream and ice cream. It really was a 2 man dish. I could barely eat half, had to save the rest for later. It seemed pricey for $6.50 but is was so huge it could easily more then fill 2 adults. Will be trying other stuff soon. I liked it better then Fruitlandia in Mesa.
