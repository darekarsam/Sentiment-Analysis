5	Got my watch repaired and looking brand new Steve is his name and you can trust him with time keepers.
4	Very friendly and helpful sales staff. I was having a watch band adjusted, and nothing more, but I would come back after the very friendly service I received.
5	My husband and I went to LV for his birthday and as I do not like purchasing presents online, I dragged him into Seiko when we were looking around the area. I was skeptical since the watch I was originally looking for was of a different brand. But I remember that I used to always wear Seiko watches as a child and have always known them to have a good history and warranty.We walked in on September 29, 2014, and browsed around. A Filipina approached us as we were browsing. She didnt push to sell but offered to help us if we find anything we'd like to look at. My husband asked to look at some watches and he immediately took a liking to 2 different watches. I didnt catch the Filipina lady's name but she was patient as we kept asking to view other watches.Thanks to her advise and patience, my husband immediately put the watch on and we left the store happy customers. If we are in the area again, we will likely stop by again.Thank you for making our choice simple and transaction speedy. Couldnt be any more happier.Mary & Arnel
