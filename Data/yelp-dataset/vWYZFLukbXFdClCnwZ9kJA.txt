5	Great company, on time, very professional, made sure job was done to my satisfaction
5	Awesome company! I needed the windows washed in a rental home I was vacating and found a Living Social coupon for this company. It's been my experience that with some of the coupons (Living Social, Amazon, Groupon, etc.) that sometimes the merchant/vendor ends up with so much business they have difficulty scheduling and sometimes the service is only perfunctory since the customer is getting a discount. Not only was Crystal Clear able to schedule the appointment for when I needed it (which happened to be on a Sunday), the work was superior. I absolutely will use them again.
5	These guys were awesome.  They went way over and above and did a great job on all the windows.  I would recommend them to anyone!
