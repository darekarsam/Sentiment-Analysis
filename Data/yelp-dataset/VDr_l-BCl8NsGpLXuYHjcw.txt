5	great, fresh, and friendly customer service. best wraps, salads, and soup in charlotte
2	Decent enough food for pre or post work out. Staff is not friendly. The majority of times I have ordered has not been a pleasant experience. I called to obtain the nutritional information of menu items and was met with "we dont know but they are healthy"........sure ok buddy. So lrt me get this srraight: a cafe in a gym whos slogan is "nutrition to fuel the body" doesnt have access to or is aware of the nutritional content of their own food. Gotcha.
5	Flavors is FABULOUS!  This cafe sells items including sandwiches, wraps, salads and soup at my office in Ballantyne.  The recipes and presentation are excellent.  I have only been able to try the Mediterranean plate, couscous salad, and bruschetta stack sandwich, but I have made it my mission to work through the entire offered menu.I can only speak for the food, because I have not been to the cafe location.  I can, however, say that everything is super-fresh, healthy and reasonably priced.
3	Great place when ur craving something light and in a hurry.My kids like the yogurt smoothies too.
4	Great breakfast burrito - the B K burrito with hot sauce is my favorite post-swim meal. They do a brisk takeout business and virtually everything on the menu is healthy. A good option if you are in the area.
