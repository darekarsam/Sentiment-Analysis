4	Bon spot pour des produits antillais. Service un peu lent pour commander,durant les heures de pointe.
5	Awesome Haitian food. Super authentic, the smell will drive you wild. I have no idea how they get such a great flavor so far from Haiti. The boulet, grio, and kabrit are all well worth the wait - 30 min for a Thursday night. They serve it with excellent pikliz, if you need more you can buy a jar or two there. This was definitely the high point of our trip to Montreal. Its one block walk from the nearest Metro station so you have no excuse for not going there.
