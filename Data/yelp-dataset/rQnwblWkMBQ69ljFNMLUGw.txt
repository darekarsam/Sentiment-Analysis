3	This is the second visit I've had at Women's Specialty Care.Cons: Having to wait over an hour past my appointment time to be seen.Granted, they were pretty efficient, but still...when I schedule two hours off work, I don't like to only have 30 minutes to get all the way across town...especially when the actual appointment was only 5 minutes long.Not being able to have a same day ultrasound done.I've been having pain for a long time, and finally made the connection that it might be something to do with my cycle and my ovaries, and I have to go to another provider for an ultrasound...another day off work, another copay...why can't they just do it in the office?Pros:The front desk staff was very patient, and very kind.The nurse practitioner that I saw, April Lavergne (I may have spelled her last name wrong) is patient, and very nice.  When I saw her last year for my annual, she was as gentle as possible, too, which is always important to me.As far as doctor's offices go, this one is A-Ok.  I'd prefer if they could stick closer to their appointment times, but only because its so hard to get time off for appointments.
