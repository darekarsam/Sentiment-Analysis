5	I love this place. The croissants bring me great joy.
4	This place is the best in upper NDG for bread that I have found. I get the Carre Ble Entier (whole wheat loaf) about three times a week, and bagettes and ciabatta's on occasion. The pastrys are good but a little pricey for my budget, not to say they aren't worth it i just preferr to spend my money on huge abouts of bread.The only thing that irritates me is in the weekends when they operate the number system. Although it is meant to make things easier, it creates havoc. Please god put the number wheel closer too, or even outside the door with a clearer sign. Then put the dam thing away on weekdays becasue people don't know when to take tickets.As you can tell I care greatly about efficient numbering service systems.
