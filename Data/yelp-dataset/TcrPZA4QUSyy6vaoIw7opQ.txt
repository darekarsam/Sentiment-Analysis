5	I've never actually personally met the guys at A-Dependable Insurance but have been with them for a few years now. Price was great especially knowing that they're working with multiple companies to see who can get the best rate for you. I've been with Progressive ever since through A-Dependable and whenever I have questions about ANYTHING...I'll call them and they not only answer my questions, but they usually go about taking care of anything that needs to get done. It's nice to have someone who actually does care. I'm not exaggerating either. Good guys and good company. I recommend just giving them a call and seeing what they can do for you. I can't imagine going anywhere else now.
5	Staff was very helpful and knowledgeable.  Also very flexible with my schedule.  Their prices are much better than Allstate.  They ensured that I got the best rate and answered all of my questions.  Even stated lafter work to assist me with getting my policy started.

They ALWAYS make sure I am properly covered and with the best value carrier available.  I dont even have to ask, they just make recommendations each year and have lowered my premium several times.  Very refreshing!
5	Quick friendly service.  These guys actually want you to get the cheapest price with the best coverage.  Imagine that, from an insurance person?
