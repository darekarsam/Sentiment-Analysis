5	This is one of my favorite Starbucks locations.   The baristas are always sweet and friendly.  And patient.  Twice I've come in wanting to try something new, and they have recommended new drinks for me to try.  One, I didn't care for and they tossed it for me and made me my normal frappuccino that I love for free.
5	Love this location. Friendly staff.
5	Great location. Easy to find and tons of parking. Super nice and friendly employees. This location is quite small inside but there is still a decent amount of seating inside. There is also some seating outside but not a lot. Fast service which I look for in Starbucks. Good food choices, they don't have everything though. Free wifi which is a plus. Clean and fresh looking bathroom. Overall this Starbucks was definitely a nice one and I had a pleasant visit with no disruptions to make it bad.
5	All i can say is this is amazing!!!! They never mess up the orders. It is always very tidy and clean and the wait isn't long at all. They have a variety to choose from and a secret menu too!
5	I have to say that this location and the one inside the grocery store has some of the best Starbucks staff members. They know my name and my favorite customized drinks. Thanks for the smiles and great drinks!!
5	Best location!! Love the staff they are the best! Service is #1... The line moves quickly and drinks are made quickly... I wish they would make this location a drive through as well - Cave Creek needs one!!
