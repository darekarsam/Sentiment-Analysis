5	First time visit. Ordered a Shoeless Joe dog (otherwise known as a Carolina dog) and a brat. Both excellent and will be back to try more from the menu.
5	Tried it for the 1st time today, small place w/ 5 or 6 tables, more room at the bar, ordered a Satchel's Paige combo (no onions for me). EXCELLENT service, fast and friendly even tho it was a bit busy, Satchel's is a carolina style  dog w/brown mustard, chili, onions and cole slaw, a perfect carolina dog!! the chili was great, the cole slaw perfectly seasoned with celery seed and creamy. the all beef nathan's dog was fried on the grill, tender and juicy, the bun was warm and soft. got the combo which came out to about $7.50, not all that cheap, but came w/ large sweet tea (very tasty) and 1/2 pound side of home style potatoes, very tasty, also.  Potatoes are small red chunked cooked on the grill w/ a healthy dose of paprika and other spices, like really good fried hash browns.    can't wait to try something else from k Dogs.!!  definitely give this place a try!!!
5	made my 2nd trip to try a #3, it was excellent!!!!! not overly spicy, but just enuff heat. made with mustard, kraut, hot peppers, red onion sauce.....yum!! can't wait to try something else!! extra fast service for a to-go dog. btw, #3 is the Babe
5	tried a different dog today, can't remember the number but it had bbq sauce , bacon, cheese and hot peppers, sounds strange, but i like to try new things, it was AWESOME!! tried for the first time the potato salad (which is the only thing on the menu they don't make themselves) and it was really good, too.
5	Hands down the best hot dogs around. I have introduced K Dogs to many people and they have all agreed: there's nothing like this around. Great owner, superb employees that always willing to assist you. Writing is just makes my mouth salivate.
3	Boo... This place is not here anymore.
