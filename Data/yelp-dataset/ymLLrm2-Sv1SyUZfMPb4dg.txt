3	This is your run of the mill Plateau hippie bar. It's an interesting place to just sit and people watch. There is definitely a strange vibe in there. They have a complete bar, a wide variety of beer, a pool table, and a foozball table. It's not my favorite bar in town, but it's worth trying once, as long as you can handle wool sweaters and ungroomed fuzzy hair;)
2	Ambiance: there is none. Cheerful service? Nope. Why do we always end up here? Because it's always open and they have Quebec microbrew beer. No...other...reason.
4	Good beer, quiet crowd nice spot to watch the world walk by. Nice for a quiet afternoon.
