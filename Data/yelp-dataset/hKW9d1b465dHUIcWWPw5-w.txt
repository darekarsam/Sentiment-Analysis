5	Clean, professional, polite patient manager.  Nurse and physician's assistant were very thorough and quickly diagnosed my problem.  They didn't try to push antibiotics but suggested them.  Everyone seemed respectful and knowledgeable.  That is all I really look for in an urgent care.
5	Went there, wait time was only about 10-15 minutes, including the time I was filling out paperwork. The front staff was alright and the nurses and doctor were knowledgeable and made me feel like I was in good hands. I felt a lot better after visiting them with the help of antibiotics of course :)
1	My wife went to this facility after falling and hurting her ankle. There was no wait and the staff was friendly enough.My first clue should have been when an aide had to be shown how to activate a cold pack.X-Rays were taken and the doctor on duty misread them as a sprained ankle. He said her pain would subside in two or three days. She was sent on her way with an ace bandage and a pair of crutches.Ten days later, a podiatrist told her she had been hobbling along on a broken ankle the whole time.
