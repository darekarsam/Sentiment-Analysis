5	I'm a big fan of convenience. I get as many items as possible from Amazon and I'm a big fan of anything automated. My office is a good distance from my home so auto repairs can be a little inconvenient . If you need tires Dan at the Tire Medic will come to you.The process could not be more simple. Provide your preferred address- he will then show up at a scheduled time at your work or home. He then will install your new tires- this took about 30 minutes start to finish. You pay (he accepts credit cards with a 2% processing fee). That's it. Donzo. Back to your life.Fast and friendly service that provides exactly what you need.
5	Dan did a great job on my wifes GL 450 Benz.  On time and great communication, great price.  Why haven't I heard of him before?  This is SO much better than going to a tire shop.  I was planning to get the car washed after he finished as the wheels were covered in brake dust.  When he was done not only had he cleaned the wheels the new tires were nicely shined!  Thank you will definitely refer Tire Medic to others and use in the future.
