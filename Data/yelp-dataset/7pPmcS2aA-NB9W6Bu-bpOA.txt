4	Gas is soooo much cheaper in South Carolina. 20 to 25 cents a gallon. It's not worth going out of your way (to save $5??) but it might be worth waiting to fill up until you cross the border.This is a bright and clean station with wide pumps and a large car wash area. Plenty of room to get in and out and back to whatever it is that people do in Fort Mill.
4	I came here Saturday. 01/08.. on the other side of the street the gas is 3.19.Right here... it was 3.09Down the street... (.25miles north = Charlotte = North Carolina) = 3.49 - 3.54You do the math!!
1	Place is useless.  Half the pumps don't work, the credit card machines are always down, and the self serve car wash that was rigged with electrical tape nearly killed me.  On top of that, if you go on the weekends, someone will try to sell you windshield repair outside when you're pumping gas.  Can I just get some gas and go without being hassled?
