4	Delicious brunch!
5	Tasty, fresh, for dinner or breakfast - it's worth it. Egg Benedict for breakfast and different tapas for dinner. Everything is unique, tasty. Service is kind and price is not so bad!!!
4	Brunch brunch I love brunch. Brunch at MIA yeah yeah yeah was so good yum yum. So let me tell you something, the brunch is NOT Indonesia. I know, right? So just lower that expectation. But keep it high cause its still pretty delightful. Menu features a bevy of omelettes, crepes and two types of eggs Benny. I'll be back to brunch again, 100% and definitely to try the dinner menu. See ya soooooon.
