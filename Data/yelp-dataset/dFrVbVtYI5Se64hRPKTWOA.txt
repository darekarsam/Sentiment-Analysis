4	Have only tried Happy Bellies delivery service once, but so far, so good! Everything worked as planned; I called, I ordered food from a friendly, efficient and knowledgable operator, and the food was delivered to me in about an hour. Quality and variety of restaurant offerings rival those of Wheel Deliver.
5	I could not have asked for better service. Alex was very polite and helpful on the phone.The food from UPs restaurant was excellent and was delivered right on time by a very polite and friendly deliveryman. I would highly recommend Happy Bellies and look forward to using them in the future.Nancy D.B.
5	I seriously love this service!!! I have no idea what i would do without besides settle for mcdonalds or be forced to make my own dinner ha! The delievery drivers have always been so friendly and the food is still hot when they get there!!! We have tried most of the resturaunts and have found something we like on every menu. The employees at happy bellies also just go above and beyond. We will continue to order once or twice a week :)
