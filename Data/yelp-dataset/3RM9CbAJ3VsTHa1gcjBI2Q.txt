1	Dear reviewers reading, Horrible customer service here. My friend and I went here to buy something sweet and right when we walk in an associate barged right into our conversation. And he was rude, he made a joke about my friend's weight, and followed us like we were going to steal something like right behind our backs talking if we were going to buy that or that. It was very horrid so we left without buying anything if he wasn't so pushy or rude we would have bought something.
4	Beautiful chocolate and nice peopleDropped in for our free piece of the month... and a few extra delicious items.  It's amazing how that member promo routinely gets me to buy more than I intended.  Dang chocolate addiction!The have some new Trufflelata flavors.  We went with the Salted Caramel and the Oreo.  So good!  At one point, we were shopping and my wife noticed our baby girl had managed to get the straw in her mouth and sucked down a quarter of the liquid chocolate before she noticed.  Once she pried Livy off, she just moaned "Mmmmm" over and over, again.  (That's my girl!)Couple new truffle flavors, as well.  All superb.  I especially liked the Hazelnut Crunch.  Service was nice, albeit a tad slow.  I forgive people when they hand me a chocolate shake at the end, though. :o)
