5	Nicest ladies run dry cleaners. Perfectly dry cleaned clothes.Always ready on time.
5	I use them a couple of times a month.  My clothes are always ready on time and I've never had an issue.
5	Altered my dress in a day! It came out perfect and was reasonably priced. Very happy customer.
1	FRAUDULENT! Found a coupon in a local mailer for 20% off dry cleaning with their name and address on the header. I clipped the coupon and took it in with me to pick up my dry cleaning. The first time they refused to accept it because it states in the small print you must present it with the incoming order. Okay, I'll accept that because I failed to read the entire coupon. BUT, the following week I took it in with a new order of shirts and presented it with the incoming order. The lady at the counter vehemently denied it was their coupon! I've been taking my dry cleaning there for years as a matter of convenience, not because their work is better than any other dry cleaners on Eastern. Now I'll go out of my way to a different cleaners that has integrity, honors their coupons, and values customer loyalty.
