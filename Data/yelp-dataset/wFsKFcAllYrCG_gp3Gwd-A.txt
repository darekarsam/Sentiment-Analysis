4	Very large building with a drive-through. Associates will even take the stuff out of your car - how easy is that? And you still get a receipt for your taxes!I've never been into the store, so I don't know much about what they're selling or prices.I haven't given them five stars because the location isn't convenient to my home.
4	When I'm on the south side of town, I feel compelled to stop at this Goodwill location. It's so large, clean and bright! I love when a thrift store seems cheery because most of the time they are just down right depressing.....bad lighting, folk music and shady dressing rooms with no doors just drapes. But not this location---it's huge with racks and racks of clothes that just want to be loved and find a good home. I find great deals on dresses and tops when I go there plus they have a selection of books that keeps me entranced for a good hour. Their knick knack section is a cluster but it's worth it to sift through everything since you never know what you can get. They have a drift thru donation drop as well, so if you feel lazy and just want to drop it off-you got it!
1	Pathetic.  Looked like a clothing explosion had gone off.  Most of the mens pants were nasty.  The mens shirts were crusty.  GROSS!ddc
4	I go here to treasure hunt for craft supplies, furniture, and appliances.   Out of all the other locations that I've tried in Charlotte, this Goodwill has the best non-clothing selection.  If you want clothes, I would recommend the Ballantyne location.  The local Rivergate stores, most notably Target and Home Depot, donate often to this store which makes for some really amazing deals on new products.  Many offices and schools also donate to this store so you will find office products and furniture on a regular basis.  For the Senior Citizen crowd, Tuesdays you get a better deal than the employees do - 25% off everything.  I keep trying to get an old lady to adopt me but so far it's a no go.
