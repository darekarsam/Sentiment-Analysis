5	ISolution came out to my home in Chandler and repaired 2 IPad screens, one that I thought was beyond repair.  Not only were they able to repair, they were able to fix corners and make it look almost brand new.  I will be using them to install my tempered screen when I get my new Phones and tablets!
5	These guys know what they are doing. Great work and the price is right!! Highly recommend
5	They repaired my iPad that was previously repaired by a company Rapid iPhone Fix (he fixed a cracked screen). Soon after the iPad had problems with the touch screen typing and he wouldn't come fix it again (customer service level over 9000 obviously).These guys came in and used way more sturdier glass and also got me some deals fixing my other old iPhones and further reinforcing my roommates current iPhone.Just by talking to them you can tell they use the best materials and actually know what they are talking about. Would recommend them to my friends in the future! And will call again if anything else breaks (crosses fingers)!
5	These guys are awesome!! They came all the way to my house in Queen Creek. They fix my iPad Air and iPhone. They were both cracked terribly. But now they look like new!! It was great deal and they added tempered glass for a discount. They were super friendly and I didn't feel weird having strangers in my house. These guys are legit! They use good quality glass compared to the other company i used. I would definitely use them again!! If you need your phone or ipad glass fix, call these guys! Serious, you don't need to look anywhere else.
5	These guys were awesome!  Thank you for fixing my phone,  looks brand new.  I'm going to recommend them to everybody I know that needs a phone repair.
