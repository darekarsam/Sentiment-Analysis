4	Great place!We were two people...ordered the Surf and Turf plate...a couple of the cocktails... and the prosciutto and brie. The portion of the shrimp was quite small...one shrimp each...everything else was a fair portion for tapas. The food was well seasoned and the Dijon mustard was especially tasty. Service was good....and the waitress was polite and gave us good cocktail suggestions!Would definitely recommend this place :)
