4	I've only been here once. Tried the wonton soup, seafood chow mein, and General Tzo's chicken. Amazing. I think the whole meal was 26 dollars, which might be a little steep for Chinese food, but I would definitely come back. I usually get orange chicken or general tzo's whenever I hear of a good recommendation, and it did not disappoint. Perfectly crispy till the last bite.
3	Oh dear! You are so consistent in your mediocrity. I know that I can count on your Pad Thai to be dry, your sweet and sour sauce to be radioactively pink, your service to be surly and abrupt, and your Pho to be edible to the point that it will satisfy my craving when I'm too lazy to go to Lil Vietnam. You've been loyal to me throughout high school, undergrad, and occasional visits when I'm back home during grad school. Hence, an extra star,  because of our long term relationship. PLEASE DE-VEIN YOUR DAMN SHRIMP THOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4	I think this place might have moved of late...the Juste Nouilles I went to today  was on Saint-Laurent. The menu at this place doesn't really feature that many noodle dishes compared to other dishes that they have despite calling themselves a noodle house. Anyways, I came here today lunch with a friend. Just one more good Montreal restaurant to add to my list! Friendly service, good lunch specials. I got a lot of food for what I paid! Definitely coming back some time.
