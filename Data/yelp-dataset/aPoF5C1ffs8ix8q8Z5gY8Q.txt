4	Talk about a literally hole in the wall restaurant! However I went here for lunch today and found myself a fresh, unique treat! I ordered the gyro plate served with steak fries and side of zesty yogurt dip. You can tell from my picture that the food just looks so fresh. I was able to wrap up my own gyro with some lettuce, tomato, and shaved lamb-beef meat. Mmm it was a light, perfect dish for my belly!!!!
5	Really happy I stopped in here, was in a hurry and STARVING. I amtrying to eat clean and thats insanely hard around here with all the declious food. I got a veggie wrap here and had them add some grilled chicko, totally scrumptious. Def try out this lil spot.
