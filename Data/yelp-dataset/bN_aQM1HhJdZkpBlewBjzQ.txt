5	I have been going to New World Nails for about two years now and have never had a bad appointment. I usually walk-in and the longest I've ever had to wait is 10 minutes. The spa pedicure is amazing and they do a perfect job with waxing. Plus, they have a bonus points system where you can earn free money towards services just by signing up! LOVE this place!
5	I have just began going to this nail salon on a regular basis. I have been there 3 times now. They are always very nice and happy to see me. They do a great job on the nails and their customer service is amazing. They always have something to watch on TV and even go so far as to ask what I want to watch. They also offer water or soda every time I'm in there. Additionally, like the other reviewer mention they have a reward program. For every dollar you spend you get a point. After a certain amount of points you get credit (Ex 100pts = 5$).  This is a great nail place- as I have been to many, I think this place is one of the best!
5	LOVE this place! I have been here probably about 2 times now and it is my new nail place. They are always very friendly and get me right in. I especially love the gel nails that they have. They lasted about 3 weeks for me. I also love the rewards program that they have, were for every dollar you get a point. After so many points you get so many dollars off. I love a good deal!
4	Clean, fresh and excellent staff!
5	Very, very nice atmosphere.  Worth the drive from S. Phx to head west for really nice people to take such good care of me and make me feel like a pampered VIP.
5	I have been going here since I have lived in az (3 years) they do great work and are always very friendly. I love the rewards program. Who can complain a free pedicure about every other month?
