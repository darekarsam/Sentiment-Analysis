1	This is the worst company ever!!!! My next door neighbor built a pergola right on top of our wall, didn't finish the side that faces my yard and has a tarp for the roof. I contacted the HOA a year and a half ago and they have done nothing even though this neighbor violated multiple guidelines for permanent structures. This company brings property values down...DO NOT USE THEM!!!!
1	Just spoke with the " admin assistant for the Sundance HOA" She has a total lack of regard for home owners and tenants a like. Takes the attitude of " well that just to bad pay your fine" I have several rental houses around the valley and this by far is the most unfriendly non helpful management company I have ever had to deal with. Can wait tIL they are voted out. If you are thinking of hiring them for your H.O.A PLEASE think twice and do your research. They have a very low Yelp rating
