4	Good shop, friendly people. If you're looking to buy a new Specialized, it's worth a visit. They let us ride one right off the rack, put pedals on it and everything.They were really helpful and there was no pressure to the sale (we haven't yet bought). Overall it was a really positive experience.I've also had a bike re-cabled there (not a bike they sell) when they first opened and they did a great job, charging me less than they quoted because they didn't feel that my brake cables needed changing. Overall they seem to try hard to put the customer first and I feel confident that they would be the kind of shop to offer the post-sales service you always wanted but couldn't find.
5	Recently purchased a bike from an individual and ended up at my local bike shop to get a nice little front basket as any bike would need. The guys working were very nice, informed and sociable. Although they only sell specialty bikes, they repair all bikes. They also do special orders for parts and accessories. As I am new to the whole "bike" thing they were nice enough to throw 4 complimentary reflectors my way (the ones I would otherwise get a ticket without!). Peter (mechanic) was more than happy to answer my questions about how to avoid getting tickets and how to lessen my chances of getting my bike stolen. They also had specials on different levels of tune-ups and after searching online it seems they have very reasonable prices. I can guarantee this will be the only shop I'll be bringing my bike to.**Their hours change seasonally so call ahead to be safe.
