5	I had Zero Energy Contractors come out and do an energy audit on my home in July 2010. I then had them do a duct seal, extra insulation as they discovered I was low and radiant barrier on the underside of my attic. There team was very professional and they were wonderful in answering all of my questions. My attic is staying cooler now with the radiant barrier and the added insulation is keeping what heat there is from seeping into my home. My air conditioning unit is now not having to work as hard in keeping my home cool. My energy bills are definitely reflecting this by a 30% saving. I'm elated!!
1	I just filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau because this company accessed my credit report without my permission.  At no time during the conversation with their representative (who knocked on my door, ignoring the NO SOLICITORS sign, and who claimed to be affiliated with the utility company) -- I never was asked about my credit or if they could check it.  This is a terrible way to try to develop a new customer base.  Outraged.  Will blast it all over the internet.  BEWARE OF ANYONE REPRESENTING ZERO ENERGY CONTRACTING.
2	This occurred around last month. and it was a little disappointing.The office were not that good on talking, they never gave me a fair quote on the deal. And the worst thing on that deal was the employee itself itself is quite lazy on the work. They don't have SOP's or Standards, if you ask me if this people are good, I would gladly say NO. Not the right people or company to hire for electric wiring problems.Ow, the name itselp implies the attitude of the electricians that came into my house. Zero Energy.
