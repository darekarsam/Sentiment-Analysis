4	A pleasant surprise!  The small cigar humidor has some fairly decent smokes at reasonable prices -- and it's buy 2 get one free.  I guess you have to go to a place like this to find a cigar that's not overpriced.  I've been to places where they charge more and the cigars are in crap condition.  Also, they allow minors in here to watch the neighborhood folk roll their own cigarettes ...
2	Not very good costumer service, came in and got the wrong hookah e-liquid and came back for exchange and they will not accept it. It's a simple mistake and easy fix but they will not help out, not recommended.
5	I highly recommend this shop, huge selections of different things. I know the prices are right and they have a great vapor selection, also I go to their vapor lounge on the weekends great hang out spot. I recommend if you vape check it out on Cave Creek just south of Green way next to Family Dollar. I give both shops Five stars for customer service and quality products.
