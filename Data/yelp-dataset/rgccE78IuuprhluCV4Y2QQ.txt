5	Service is excellent, showroom is beaitiful, and the changing rooms are just so freaking cute. Ladies are very helpful, and offer a lot of praise for you in every item you wear, but not a lot of constructive critisism. I'll leave that to my mom. She's a professional critique! :P
3	Interesting store, cute clothes, definitely not my type of store since it only sells women's products.
5	This is my favorite store hands down. I love their clothes and they have fair prices for the quality. If you join their loyalty program you get tons of coupons and discounts. Every time I have been here the service is impeccable. The staff is never pushy and always ask my name (and call me by my name after that) and I love how they pick out items you might like. Its like having a personal shopper at no additional cost.A+
