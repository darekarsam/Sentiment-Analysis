4	You know a restaurant is awesome when you ask them to skip the shrimp in your Singapore noodles and they compensate for what's missing by giving you a ton of extra chicken.It was the best.
2	I've been eating at ASEAN for a while now.  Take out used to be good.  Tonight it just sucked. Disappointing.   I wanted ASEAN food and also sushi.   To start sushi was badly cut the size was all wrong big pieces then small tiny piece and also it wasn't fresh I had sashimi.    I would suggest rolls if you want sushi.   We also ordered salt pepper squid it came soggy and not great also the orange beef was soggy.   When you go In person it's usually better.   I think they are just going downhill.   They just don't put the love they used to.   To bad.  Won't order again.  Will go try it again in person.   All you can eat is hard to resist
4	One of the best Asian restaurants in Montreal. This is not high cuisine but the food is delicious. It's perfect for a take-away or quick meal after work.
