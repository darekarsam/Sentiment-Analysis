2	In the center of quebecs food capital. I'm shocked it's still open after all there years. I went once because I lived 1 block away. I still live one block away. I never went back.
1	Way too expansive! One of the worst couscous I ever had, tasteless. Ugly place. Take the +$10 for two, it's a better deal.The star goes for the music and staff!

4	A bit expensive but the couscous was great and the owner threw in some freebies that were much appreciated
