5	Anything you need for your bike come to this place! Kenny is the man! Cool guy with an awesome godly attitude! everyone who hangs out there is respectful, welcoming, and also praises the lord. If you dont need work done on your bike they hold a Bible study on tuesday if anyone is interested give them a call for more information about that. Anyone is welcome
2	Friendly bunch here, but no attention to detail and service was aloof.  If you have work done here, take a look at your receipt.  There is no detail as to what work was actually performed - just a price for the service requested.  If you pay several hundred bux  for routine maintenance it would be nice to have a list of what was added, replaced  or changed for your records.  The tech instead said, "we check everything". Nice to know, but I would like to see it in writing.
