4	i discover this awesome place last year when i was looking for stuff for a bachelor party. i spent like an hour or so going through all corners of the store and found a bunch of fun stuff and the best of all, a blowup sheep doll. yes, a sheep! a sheep that we named wanda ;pprobably the most wtf fun we could have had happen with wanda.price is ok, can be a bit expensive but you can find almost anything (even my mickey ears) and let your imagination go hence the name, imagine le fun you can have with this, that or that.
4	Great big costume shop that's full of good ideas all year round. There's a whole section of higher quality wigs and prosthetics in addition to rows and rows of creepy outfits, cute get ups for kids, hats, tiaras, and all kinds of plastic medieval weapons and things. Fair prices, friendly service, quick moving with lots of stock even the day before Halloween. Nice to have this option on St Laurent!
