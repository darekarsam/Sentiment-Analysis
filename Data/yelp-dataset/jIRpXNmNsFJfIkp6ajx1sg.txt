5	We had a very positive experience with Mendez Brothers Painting recently when they painted the whole house and the outside wall surrounding the house.  They did everything that they said they were going to do, including starting on time and finishing on time.  I would highly recommend them to anyone in the area.
5	The Mendez brothers are a complete team.  There are 10 brothers and you can do your whole house with this group.I called and they came out immediately to give me a estimate.  I had damage from the rain and needed drywall and painting and a new tile floor.  Plus I needed a faux painter.They gave me an estimate and sent out a drywall man immediately.  They were here to follow up with the job.  They than sent out a faux painter, who arrived in one day and than the painters.When I told them I was replacing my carpet with tile, they sent out men to do the tiling. Everything went well, but I had some paint off after the floor went in, called them and they sent out a man to retouch the paint.  I would recommend this team.
5	Humberto the owner is a complete professional.  He arrived on time for every appointment, communicated with us via text to keep us informed on the project. His estimate was completed on the spot and well within our budget (including him picking up the paint).  The previous painter we had to do an estimate took over four days to email an estimate to us --- and it was twice as much!!!!  When they arrived for the job this morning his team was professional and courteous.  They ensured the protection of our furniture and flooring, as well as minimizing any fumes going into the other parts of the house.  They were so efficient they finished 1/2 a day ahead of time.  We are going to have them come back to do our kitchen and the outside of the house.  I would highly recommend the Mendez Brothers --- you will not be disappointed.
