4	Awesome little hardware store in just the right place. It's nothing like a home depot. If you're looking to renovate your kitchen then this isn't the place. But for all the little things it's great
4	Lovely little hardware store.  Like Mike S. pointed out, this isn't for renovating your entire kitchen (though you probably could! I'm sure chatting with the staff would yield just about everything you'd need), this is more of a "depanneur" of a hardware store.  Need a couple of screws?  Run here.  Need a tube of glue?  Here you go!  Need a flower pot and some soil?  Done and done!Also fun is the housewares section.  Decently priced utilitarian kitchen stuff, for when your spatula from dollarama snaps in half and you vow to never buy really cheap kitchen stuff again.  Or when you need a meat grinder or a pasta machine (not joking!  they've got them!)  They also have grills, pull shopping carts, patio furniture . . . just about anything your apartment might need, they might have it.
