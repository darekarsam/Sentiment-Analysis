4	I really enjoyed the wi-fi service while waiting for my oil change. The prices are average rates. Expect good customer service. Unless you make an appointment your estimated wait time may be an hour like mine was. But when you need an oil change and have some time to spare, why not?
5	I have been in the market for new wheels and tires for about a month. I found 602 Auto Sports online and was impressed by their A+ rating from the BBB. From the moment I walked in I was amazed by their high level of customer service and excellent pricing. I worked with Memo to get new wheels and tires on my 2014 Toyota Tundra. He was helpful and made the whole process fast and simple. In the end I was very satisfied by the way my truck turned out. I will recommend anyone I know to 602 Auto Sports. Superb job...
1	Worst experience I have ever had. They jacked my car up in the wrong spot and bent a piece of the frame on my brand new 2014 corolla causing the fender to bend out of place. Do not goto this place these guys are illegals and have no idea what they are doing.
