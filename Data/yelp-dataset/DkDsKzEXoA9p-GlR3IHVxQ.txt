5	I am very picky about my vehicles, one of which is a rare sportscar, so I usually avoid quick lubes but this place is different. The manager, Amanda, keeps the shop in pristine clean condition and was very accommodating of my desire to use my own oil which I brought (again, I am different than most, they have plenty of oil options for people that just want what their manufacturer specifies). The prices were reasonable, the crew was knowledgable and friendly, and the job was done right. I will be coming back!
5	I love the convenience and speed of Valvoline. I have been to this particular location twice and they continue to impress me with their friendliness and speed. Amanda is awesome at what she does! My check engine light came on the other day and they were able to help me figure out the issue along with what other recommended maintenance should be done. I never felt pressured to buy anything or get anything done to my car, they just guided me in the right direction. Being a 25 year old female, I appreciate that so much in the car industry! I will be returning for my routine maintenance to this location.
5	Great service and the price wasn't too outrageous. I was in and out in ten minutes. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
