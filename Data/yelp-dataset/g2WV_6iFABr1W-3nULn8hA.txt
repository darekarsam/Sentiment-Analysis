4	When categorising this shop you should consider it to be a fusion of a pound shop and a pound stretcher with characteristics of both yet also and rather unexpectedly offering a range of Polish goods as well.  You do get a decent amount of good deals from here especially on regular household items that you use on a regular basis making it ideal for those who are attempting to bring down the cost of their weekly shop without sacrificing anything from that shop.The shop itself is well stocked though offer little beyond items that are regularly bought, but as far as I'm concerned this goes in its favour rather than against it as it does enable it to be able to focus more on that one area helping it be able to offer great value in that area.  All round a very good shop and it is worth considering as a place to pick up some of your weekly shopping.
