5	Food is excellent. Better wings than anywhere..... They don't compare to quaker steak.  Monday is wing night !!!! Also try the buffalo chicken pizza. It's killer !!!!!!
4	I had boondas today: pizza with bacon. Really pretty good. The sauce was what made it stand out. And prices are pretty good, al least for the pick up special.
3	One of the better local pizza places; however, if they were more consistent they could be a 4 star, for West Mifflin, restaurant. We normally order wings and maybe salads from this place. Monday is indeed their wing night, and some times on wacky Wednesday, and they are 58 cents a wing with a minimum of 1 dozen. At that price, it is certainly not the best deal on wings in town, but it is decent and normally works when we don't feel like driving somewhere further. They have plenty of wing flavors to choose from (check out the pictures of the menu), but picking a favorite and sticking with it is difficult because they aren't consistently made. Sometimes the wings are great, but other times they are overcooked, small and/or lacking sauce (or as in yesterday you might get the wrong sauce all together).  We try to ask for a little extra sauce on the side to overcome at least one of these issues. Yesterday was not one of the better days for wings from them, but I will order take out from them in the future (probably at least once a month). I have had other things from their menu that I would recommend like their buffalo chicken hoagie, reuben roll, and their buffalo chicken salad.
