1	The people in the leasing office are extremely rude and wouldn't help me at all I was really looking forward to viewing the property and now I won't be back!
5	This place is really nice, and the staff is extremely nice and helpful. The reviews complaining about a $30/mo trash collection fee. Really? They pick it up from your door. How can you complain about that? If you can't afford to live in North Scottsdale and $30/mo is going to break your bank, then move to old town where its ghetto and cheap. Period.
