4	Food was good - what you would expect from this chain. Service was wonderful, with excellent staff working together, efficient, and friendly. Clean.

4	BoJo's, yeah!I love it when you watch a Panthers game, the camera pans over to Jerry Richardson in the owners booth, there he is drinking a large BoJo's sweet tea.
4	So bad that it's good. Steak, egg, and cheese biscuit should be my morning ritual. But I won't; even though I want to. It seems that I can smell the buttery biscuit from miles away and I refrain from making it a habit.You know you can pre-order an entire fried turkey and sides during the holidays right? Look into it. While I haven't personally ordered one, I've eaten some and, well, it was pretty darn good.
