1	Did this re-open next to Total Wine this year? If so, this place is a hot mess. Literally. The store is in shambles and its 100+ degrees out still and they're apparently too cheap to pay for a/c. Makes for an uncomfortable shopping experience!They're selling over priced crap.... most of which, it was tough to find an item that wasn't marked down for being damaged already. I weep for these employees.
2	Not impressed.  This place doesnt have alot of stuff and I can never find what I need. I rather shop at Spirit Halloween.
