5	"The podiatrist: If you don't walk in with swagger, you'll walk out with it."But seriously folks... Dr. Beecroft is excellent! He's warm, communicative and thorough. The staff is friendly and the place is run efficiently.I don't *want* to go back but if I need to at any point, I won't mind.
5	I LOVE this office. This is what medical care should be.  On a referral, I went to this office for a bad case of plantar fasciitis. Dr. Beecroft is wonderful. I was squeezed on a Friday morning.  Thank goodness because I was in a lot of pain.It was recommended that I go for ultra sound therapy a few times a week. I was dreading taking time off work to go since doctors office are notoriously running late.  This was not the case here. I NEVER waited for more than a couple of minutes before the tech took me back. My appointments were quick and enjoyable. The staff is considerate, kind, efficient, and fun to chat with.  I always looked forward to visiting. :) A couple of weeks ago, Dr. Beecroft said I was good to go. No more PT, no more visits.  It was truly sad to say good-bye to the staff. They are the best.  I will CERTAINLy go back when my feet ail me again.
5	Just had surgery on my foot and this place made me feel so comfortable and answered every question that I had. Dr Beecroft was wonderful and I would recommend that anyone having any kind of procedure to ask for him.
5	I went here with an emergency foot surgery back in 2007. Dr Crezee was my foot surgeon and he did an exceptional job, surgery was outpatient and only took an hour. Would highly recommend them! Back for other foot concerns.
