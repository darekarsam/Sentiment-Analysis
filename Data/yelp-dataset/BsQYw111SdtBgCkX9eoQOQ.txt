5	I was very impressed with this place. My friend and I went here for a quick girls retreat and were both very happy with their service.I had searched yelp for some awesome places to go near home and found nothing great, so I figured since I had some shopping to do why not try the salon in Walmart.We were greeted immediately by friendly people who spoke pretty good English.They were fast and good. We never felt rushed at all.I am definitely going back.
5	friendly staff and awesome work on brows and mani-pedi :)this where my mom, sis and I would always get our nails done they've become real close to us They offer great nail care tips and make sure that you get best service stop by and have see for yourself!
2	Worst nail place. Left glue all on my fingers, not straight and when u say something they say it's normal. No customer satisfaction. Left gobs of acrylic under nails. Nails not even some shorter then others. Eyebrows waxed in the same area as nails done,no privacy.
