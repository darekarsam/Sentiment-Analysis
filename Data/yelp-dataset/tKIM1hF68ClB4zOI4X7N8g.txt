3	A tiny new-comer to the area, this cafe is suitable for one on one talks with a friend over coffee, which is exactly what I did this morning. You know what it is? It is small, but you don't get the feeling everyone is trying to listen in on your conversation. Sure, the place wasn't crowded, only a handful of clients, mostly people just like us, having a quiet conversation amongst themselves.The latte I had was perfect and the bite of my GFs' breakfast sandwich (feta and dill omelet?) was quite good. If I lived in the area, this would likely become one of those places I would hit up quite often.
5	Love this place, cute,very small, & free wifi. I'v had a soy latte which was very good quality coffee and I am a serious coffee drinker so I like to think I know a thing or two about coffee; loose leaf soy chia latte excellent!! The muffins are good to have as well iv had a (coconut,banana,chocolate chip& a oatmeal banana one as well) all great with a chai latte or soy latte. Last but not least iv had a great sandwich with apples,a bit of honey, walnuts, I believe a bit of pumpkin seeds with Brie cheese.
3	this is the backup of the backup of the backup of the backup coffee plan..i really only go here because my usual coffee spot is full and my 2nd choice is full too and so on. and there's the fact that sometimes, you don't feel like walking too far away from the metro station like on very cold days. its almost next to beaubien metro station.the coffee is ok. don't expect flavorful, bitter, acidic coffee. its on the extremely smooth easy to swallow kind. not the most satisfying cup of coffee one could get but decent enough.the big plus about this place is the opening hours. its the only one around the block that stays open late in the evening while your usual spots close in the early evening. place is usually packed during daytime with off days and is most of the time packed after 7pm because the surrounding coffee shops just closed.and free wifi is always good
