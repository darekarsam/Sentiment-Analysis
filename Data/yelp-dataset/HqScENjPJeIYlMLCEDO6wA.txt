5	I've been going to Moda for the past 5 years and I absolutely love everyone there. They go above and beyond to make sure you are 100% happy with their work. The owner Adrian is pretty awesome and his business partner Louis ( Dad and Stylist ) I highly recommend Moda to anyone. And they're not going to break the bank eighther.
1	Just moved to Charlotte and have been hesitant to find a stylist because I have long hair and am fearful someone will just chop it all off. I thought I'd try this place and so I did. I was literally 2 mins late the owner was standing outside the salon with an irritated look on her face. As I walked up she walked back in and then said she was about to call me because she thought I got lost? 2 mins late ? Really. Then she proceeded to talk about her likes and dislikes about customers and her job. She stopped cutting my hair and blow drying my hair to answer her phone and to even just check it. I should have known better when I walked in she was the only one there. She seemed very callous while speaking with me throughout the appointment and when I told her how I felt about someone cutting my hair she said "it's hair it will grow back" I realize that's your opinion but it has taken me years to grow my hair out to the length I want. Overall the cut was okay....I won't be going back. My personal opinion....she should focus more on her "other businesses" and get out of being a stylist. I do not recommend to anyone!
