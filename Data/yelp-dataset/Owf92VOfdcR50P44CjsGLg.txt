5	I love this place for my nails and pedicure! I am so particular, PICKY and meticulous with everything from brows, skin and haircut and Tina does everything to perfection like the way I like it! I have never had to look at my French and say anything bad about them! She is perfect with polish, the smile line and making sure there is no cuticle or skin left! And Ricky is also da bomb at pedicures! If you want someone to get all the crust and cuticle, he is the one to go to!!
4	Great first time experience! $10 for a manicure!!!! You cannot say no! She did a great job esp with my cuticles! Thank you! I will return!
5	Absolutely love this place. All the staff members are cordial and nice!  She does a great job with waxing but manicures and pedicures are awesome here!  You're not rushed out or feel neglected!  The prices are reasonable and the ambience is positive! Go see Tina!
