4	Alright so I'm not a huge fan of Arby's. I mean, I'll eat it if it's put in front of me, but generally I find everything to be a little gooey. Weird. BUT, I gave this particular Arby's four stars for the radicalist (as in the most radical, not like a radicalist who overthrows governments and stuff) sign ever to grace the Arcadia hood. It's right up there with the great Courtesy Chevrolet sign on Camelback.Also: they have a bell you can ring for good service! I think every Arby's has it, but I love it because people will only ring it literally AS they are running out the door.
4	I'm a fan of Arby's because I enjoy their Reuben Sandwich and their Turkey Sandwich. It's a chill place with just the right A/C setting. I usually catch up on my reading during lunch so this place ticks all the right boxes in that regard.My major gripe about this Arby's is in their haste to always upsell you they charge you more than what you order. I upgrade my drink size but it doesn't mean I want their gigantic curly fries. I finally had to read the riot act today and spell it out for them. Many years ago you would get a print out receipt of every item you ordered. These days you get the total you were charged on your credit card but you don't have any idea if you were charged correctly on each item.So even though I still like you Arby's, I'm not ringing that bell.
5	Although I'm a great fan of Arby's roast beef I have to honestly say that the apple crisp was one of the worst tasting things I have ever eaten at Arby's.
