5	I came into this location July 2nd a little after 1pm. I found the staff member to be very helpful over the phone and in person. I used the Versa Spa medium for $32. I did find this rate slightly pricey compared to the place I go to in Las Vegas which is $25. I was bummed that they did not take AMEX, thankfully I had some cash. The tanning room was clean. 5-stars for having foot covers, wipes and body spray! I probably will not be back since I am not local. I reccomend others trying this place out for an awesome spray tan!
