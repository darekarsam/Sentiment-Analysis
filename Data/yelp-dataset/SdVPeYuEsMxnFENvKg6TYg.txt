5	Cute little stand in the Fashion Square food court.  Yummy smoothies and of course -- the famous ice cream! Grab your dessert then work of calories shopping around this huge mall :)
4	Kiosk in the food court! Lots of flavors of ice cream to choose from! It was an awesome treat before our movie! They also had smoothies, so I went with the mango smoothie instead of an ice cream cone. Service was quick and friendly!
4	Ice cream kiosk in the Fashion Square Mall food court. I got a strawberry sorbet in a chocolate dipped sprinkle waffle cone and it was scrumptious! I think the strawberry sorbet was sweet without being overly decadent so I was able to wolf down the whole thing! So yummy, but a tad pricey which is why I knocked off a star.
