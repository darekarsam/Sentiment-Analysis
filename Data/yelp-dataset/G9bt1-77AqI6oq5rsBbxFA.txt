5	I walked into Macy's recently in search of a new foundation.  The cosmetic options at this location are more limited than I am used to at a department store, however, I was extremely impressed with the products I ended up buying and the service I received. I was greeted immediately and although the salesperson was busy with another customer, she made sure to acknowledge me and let me know she'd be right with me.  As soon as she finished the other customer's transaction, she found me and asked how she could help.  She helped me to choose a new foundation, that matched my skin tone and my skin type.  As I was checking out she gave me a sample of a new product to try and told me when it was gone, she would supply a second sample so I could be sure I wanted it before purchasing the full size.  She also sold me a face wash, helping me to understand how it works and why it would be good for me.  So far, I love the foundation, face wash and the sample product I was given.  Thank you so much for being helpful and to the point.  This was a very pleasant experience and I highly recommend this location!
