4	The people there are very helpful. I got my shoes stretched out, a new heel, buffed, and waterproofed for $30. My mom got new heels on her shoes and it was $10. When she got them back they were shined up real nice. I would go back. Cash only.
5	I love this place! I had 3 pairs of shoes that needed fixed BAD, 2 were so bad I haven't worn them for a year or so. They were all heels but the heels were missing the rubber bottoms and the material on the heel was ripped up and worn. I never used a shoe repair place before but I'd hate to spend money on new shoes. The guy, I'm assuming the owner, was very nice. He even made sure to get them done in just 3 days before I left for vacation when it normally would take a week. For $40 I got 3 pairs of shoes fixed that cost me almost $300. I always prefer to fix things if possible rather than just replacing them, I will definitely be back here for ANY shoe needs! The worse pair I had were black heel boots and they look brand new again!! Very very happy girl!
5	Great service, quality work, good prices.  What more can you ask for?  Oh, I know... it's independently owned.  Love it!
5	Great work on my wife's boots, they looked brand new when we got them back. Friendly customer service, will definitely take my business back in the future. Cash only was a bummer but it's s small business I get why it's that way.
