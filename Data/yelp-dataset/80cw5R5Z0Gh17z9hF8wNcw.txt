4	I don't really know anything about soccer, but now that my 8-year-old is playing I am finding that there is a lot to learn about teams and equipment. Luckily, the people at Soccer Locker are great to work with and more than willing to share their knowledge! My son had outgrown his soccer cleats since last Fall, and luckily we hadn't replaced them yet, because in our first week of playing indoor soccer we found out that the kids can't wear cleats on the field, but rather flat or turf shoes. However, since he's also going to be participating in an outdoor camp this summer, we needed something that works for both. Gaby, at Soccer Locker, was very helpful in showing us the turf shoes that will work for both. She also helped him find the right size soccer ball that he wanted.Additionally, with the World Cup starting up, they have a large supply of team shirts, balls, scarves, and every other accessory you could want for national teams, MLS teams, Premiere League, and other club teams.Service is great, prices are reasonable and you even get a 10% discount if you're playing in a league at the Phoenix Sports Centre where the store is located. We will definitely be back!
5	I have been trying to trying find soccer cleats for my daughter for the past month.  She is 13 and in between sizes.  Not to mention looking for just the right design. We were on vacation in the Phoenix area and a Yelp and Google search lead us to this store.  It was perfect great selection and the prices were so reasonable.  The same cleat we picked at $90 was $150 at Dick's sporting goods.  They were so nice and have allot of soccer gear and clothes too.  To help us get just what we wanted Felipe was patient and brought us about 10 pairs of shoes making sure the fit was correct. If you are in the area a must stop.  Just check the opening times, 1200 Mon - Fri. Thank you she got a nice pair and I saved $$$ not a bad day
