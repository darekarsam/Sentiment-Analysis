3	I used to live four houses down from this little corner bar, and since I love dives, I convinced my guy that we should go in and have a drink. The place is somewhat small, basically just the first floor of a small rowhome. Most people sit at the bar but there are also a few small tables throughout.The bartender was friendly and I was so delighted when she literally pulled two frosty glass mugs out of the fridge and poured our beers into them! Nice.The clientele was down and out but quiet, of various races, and I never saw any thing go down the couple times we went there. Just a pretty chill corner dive.
5	If you like cheap, divey bars you need to get yourself to Teabags.  One of the very few bars that I've been to in Pittsburgh with a legitimate mix of people from all walks of life.  The bartenders are almost always lovely (only had one wacky one so far) and the patrons are delightful.  There's a pool table that is usually open, though it's not the finest table in town it fits the vibe of the place.  The drinks are dirt cheap.  The beer is always cold and the mix drinks are strong.  This place is just really perfect in my opinion and I'm just sad I didn't discover it sooner.
5	I lived next to Teabags for over a year before checking it out and I definitely regret waiting that long. It is huge on the inside, tons of bar space and plenty of room to stand and play pool. Clean for a dive bat, private bathrooms downstairs. Excellent jukebox. Staff has always been a delight, have enjoyed watching hours of random nonsense on tv with them. Prices are dirt cheap. They have a house drink called like the deep blue or something that is jack, schnapps, and curacao, get that you will not regret it.
