1	Went in looking for new running shoes. I was promptly greeted by an employee who was already with a couple so I walked toward the back where there were two employees talking. One walked out, I told him I was looking for new running shoes. He told me I was in the wrong section (I was in the kid's section because I was looking for help...). He sang a song about how I needed to move forward, then started talking to the other customer about how cold it was. I stood looking at nothing, waiting for this person to direct me toward a good pair of running shoes. Two minutes later with no help, we left with no goodbye. I hope that guy doesn't live on commission because he's probably starving. Epic fail in customer service.
4	Came in here to just look around. I saw that NCAA hoodies were on sale 2 for $35. I bought some. (Go Rebels!) The employees were nice and attentive, even offering to help us get sizes from the back without us having to ask.I have not purchased shoes here, but I recommend this store and would go here again.Note, they have a rewards card. I'm not sure about the benefits, inquire in-store.
3	The manager was kind of rude... But whatever. Bought some shoes during their end of season sale. The sales associate was nice and accommodating.
