4	Super staff specially made a wrap - recreating ingredients without the crazy things I am allergic to just from me asking what was in it and saying 'darn I can't eat that' Thank You!
5	Being located right in front of my office I end up for lunch here almost every other day.I'm a die hard fan of the Southwest Chicken Salad and their Black bean burger. They always customize my salad no matter how many variations. Now that may be a standard practice but since they ask me if it looks good before packing it up, that's what I call service!And oh, the dark roast coffee. Can't start my day without it.
