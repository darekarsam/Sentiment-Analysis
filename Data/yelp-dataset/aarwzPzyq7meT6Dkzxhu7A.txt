4	I have been going to Brenda to get my nails done for many years. She is located inside the Total Bliss Salon in Gilbert. I never had any problems with my nails lifting or anything like that. The salon is always very clean and all the instruments used are sterile. Brenda does regular manicures, pedicures, acrylics, gels and shellac polish. She also does different kinds of artwork with all the nail mediums as well.
5	Brenda is one of the sweetest people I know!! Her customer service is amazing and she is so talented. It never fails that I bring in a unique design for my nails and she makes it happen. I get tons of compliments on my nails and she was sweet enough to do my nails and bridal party for my wedding. Getting my nails done by her is a treat:)
5	Brenda has been my nail tech for several years. She is one of the most creative nail techs that I have been to. I get compliments all the time about the designs on my nails. She uses quality products and is an all around great person. So pamper yourself and give Brenda a call!
