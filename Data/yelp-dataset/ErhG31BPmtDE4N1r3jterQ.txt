3	This is a nice little location; off the strip so it feels less crowded and more relaxed.The girls seemed to be bothered by having to help us, but they weren't rude.I wouldn't mind coming back here.
4	After working all day inside a museum - I need sunshine, I need fresh non-filtrated air!  Stopping by Town Square is always a treat and, for me, that usually means I need to stock up on my Origins products.  The sales girls at this Origins location are very friendly and approachable in contrast to the staff at another deep valley location. This location seems to have a very high rate of turnover though.  I rarely see the same girl twice. That said, I love Origins products!  Being a middle-aged female who lives, primarily, cruelty-free - I switched to Origins products because they are not tested on animals and often do not contain animal derived ingredients - yet still produce high-end results in the anti-aging department.  Cruelty-free + wrinkle-free = awesome!Pricey though!
5	Love this place! The moisturizers and the make-up and the masks, what else can a girl need? The staff is helpful and do not overkill on selling which is nice. This place takes my money and I love them.
