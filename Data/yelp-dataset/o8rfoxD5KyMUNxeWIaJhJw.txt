4	Great local bar. This place might become our go-to for game nights. Comfortable stools, nice vibe with wood floors and a copper ceiling. Not too loud, you can hear the game but you can talk, too. I've been here on a Thursday night and a Tuesday evening and it's been the same vibe both times. There is a jukebox - touchtunes- though, so they may have other nights with a different flavor. I don't know why you would list this place as a $$$, I'll add some of the posted specials here: $2 IC 12oz bottles During Pirate Games$2 16oz draft Miller Lite during Pens GamesHappy Hour 5-7, $1 off everything$4 Chicken burrito w/ guacamole and chips$2.50 Jumbo soft pretzelThese are the specials I can see from my seat. I think they have flatbread, too. This place would be practically perfect, except, as I just found out, it's a smoking establishment.
4	Great neighborhood bar! Although I wish there was a non-smoking bar in Polish Hill, at least Pope's has a pretty serious air filtration system in the ceiling, so it's not as bad as some of the others. It's nice to have the option of a cleaner bar for my friends who don't appreciate the grunge scene as much. If my parents were in town, this would definitely be the neighborhood bar I'd take them to! They have a good selection of craft beers on tap and even have a few sandwich options. The owner is often there bartending and he is very friendly!I'm glad Pope's is in the neighborhood!
3	Good little neighborhood bar. Cheap drinks and a clean place. It's a good stop for a drink if you're in the area, but I wouldn't go completely out of my way to go there.
5	This bar is a gem in Polish Hill! Great drinks for cheap. the food is wonderful and reasonably priced. Well whiskey, diet coke and grenadine for $2.50. Tammy the bartender is great and makes a mean drink. It's like Cheers, where everyone knows your name.
