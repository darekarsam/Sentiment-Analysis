1	Suck it ticketmaster. Not only do you have a monopoly on concert tickets, but you charge ridiculous prices, don't give enough to the artists, and then you add in all these silly 'convenience' fees and 'handling' charges that push ticket prices up 50% from the advertised price. A pair of $25 tickets can easily run upwards of $100 dollars when all is said and done. Thats just wrong.The other day i heard on the radio that a local station was doing a deal where that day only you could get tickets to see one of my GF's favorite bands for $10 a piece. So as soon as i get to the office, i jump online and start to buy tickets, after all your silly fees and charges they were $25 bucks a piece, that's more than double the advertised price. Did i mention that i hate you?
1	I'd give Ticketmaster negative stars if it were possible.  They charge ridiculous fees, they only send your tickets to your billing address (I'm on vacation here) in about 2 weeks and you can't get the tickets anywhere except ticketmaster.  I wonder if the venues care about how much business they are losing because of ticketmaster? Plus the website doesn't work very well, not displaying parts of the pages necessary to actually buy a ticket, or it can't find the event.I'll just skip the shows or try to buy from the stand-by list.  Ticketmaster sucks.  I'll never attempt to use them again, I'll never go to a show that requires me to buy through them and I'll write to all the shows I can find to let them know how bad ticketmaster is.
1	I bought 2 tickets 85.00 assigned  seating the total came to 250.00 and received 49.95 first come seating.....I am furious!!! As far as I am concerned Ticket master is the biggest rip off ever. They should not be allowed to do business. DON'T USE THEM!!!
1	So so many hidden fees!  Don't believe ticket prices on the website. You should expect $10~ 15 as a hidden fee per ticket.
