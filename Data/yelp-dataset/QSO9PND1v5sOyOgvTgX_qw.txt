4	Had a three course meal here the other night!Really surprised this place hasn't been reviewed yet! The food was gorgeous! I had fishcakes for starter, lamb for main and chocolate cheesecake for dessert (yummmmmmmmmmmm)Really great meal! only critism was the waiters daft outfits! blue shirts that looked silly! but the food was GREAT!!!
4	Great restaurant with good value scottish food. Fixed price menu so if you go as a group everyone knows what to expect. Go with our book group so lots of chat.
