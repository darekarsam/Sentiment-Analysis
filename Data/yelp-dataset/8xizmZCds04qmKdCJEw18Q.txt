3	This is a standard firehouse - good, warm subs! They also have one of those coke machines where you can pick flavors and such... The parking gets a little hairy so come early or just try to avoid peak eating times or prepare to walk from a couple parking lots away...
1	My first and last visit to Firehouse Subs.  I ordered a Turkey Verde sandwich from the under 500 calories menu.  I took it to go and when I reached my destination- less than a 10 minute drive- I sat down to have lunch- or so I thought.  The sub was soggy- covered in some strange damp slime- it feel apart in my hand as I tried to pick it up.  I took a bite- as the soggy sandwich continued to fall apart - it was a soggy tasteless mess.  Ugh- straight to the trash.  So, I  just spent $9.00 on a sweet tea.  Not happy .  Too bad- I really like the idea/concept of Firehouse as I have many friends in Chicago who are   firefighters.  I like that firefighters started this place and that some of the proceeds from each sale go to to charities that benefit firefighters and their families.  On the positive side, the store was very clean and the employees friendly and efficient, however I will not return.
4	Hard to beat a pretty decent meal for 2 adults and 2 kids for under $20Good subs, kids friendly and good location.Good option for sunday's lunch!
1	Ordered over phone. They said 10 mins. I arrived in 15; order not started yet. One girl was restocking chips, and the other one told me she was cleaning up a flood in the back. I understand that things happen, but she wasn't really apologetic, didn't offer a concession or upgrade for me having to wait when my order wasn't even started yet, and it seems the girl that was restocking the chips could've been making my sandwiches while the other girl was cleaning up the so-called flood in the back. I was not a happy camper.
