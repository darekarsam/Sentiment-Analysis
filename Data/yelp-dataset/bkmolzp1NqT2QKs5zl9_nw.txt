5	They have good wings here, and many different flavors you can choose. The wings seem bigger than any other places that I went before. I like that they have free Wi Fi here, and the restaurant is clean. Will definitely come back for more wings :)
1	Very disappointed , found hair in my burger .. There boneless wings was nasty , the sauce was so thick and caked on like frosting ....  I would never return back . I wouldn't give any stars but I had no choice too .
1	I came into this place at 1pm and there was one man sitting waiting for his food. I ordered a California Burger and an order of zucchini. I sat down and waited for my to go order.  Six other people came in after me and received their food BEFORE me.  I finally at 1:20pm got up and asked about my food taking so long and the lady at the counter (who lacks customer service skills) told me that my food took so long because of what I got.  I saw people get chicken wings, hamburgers, etc while I was waiting.   I think that was just an excuse because maybe they forgot my order?Finally got back to work with my food and my zucchini was burned and gross. I have a feeling that the person who left them a good comment....works there because this place is terrible.  Food isn't good, customer service needs lots of work.  I won't be back.
4	Wings are really yummy And at a fair price.. Best ive had here in this area.. Customer service is ok they do need a lil work on that
