4	I love how you can deposit cash and checks through their ATMs. Even in the drive thru!
2	Not pleased with this branch at all. :/ I see no logic in telling me I can't use checks I am cashing to get a cashiers check when I am an account holder.  BUT..... I can cash those checks come back and they would issue me one? Fucking stupid! !!!! How is that logical? All they did is piss me off to the point I won't come to this branch.  I seriously want to walk back in and get a money order with the teller right next to the other guy.  Grrrrrrrrrr.
1	Let's say you go into the bank with a jar full of quarters that you have been saving for 2+ years. The bank has you put that money into a sack and they take that sack to count it in the back out of your view. Now you have counted these coins twice and you are 100% sure of the amount. The teller comes back and tells you the amount is $760 LESS then you have anticipated. What do you do?This happened today at this Bank of America to my husband and they said too bad, prove that amount to us. Cops say it's a civil matter. Won't return the coins either because they go to a magic vault to be counted and they can't get them back! Complaint filed with bank, so we shall see. This is why I left BofA years ago. SHADY and no customer service. CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNTS WITH THEM!
