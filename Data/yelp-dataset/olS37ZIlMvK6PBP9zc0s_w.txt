5	Great pedicures!
5	Amazing pedicure. They do two rounds of callus remover followed by a Mr. Pumice exfoliation and then leg scrub, massage, and paraffin bath. Priced comparably to other salons with way better attention to detail. Great gel manicure as well with LED light. I'm now a client for life.
1	I was a long time customer called in to ask for a time quite when I was giving one not only did I wait 45min past my time even my pedicure water got cold. Then instead of coming to me they wanted to do another lady's eyebrows before attending to me needless to say did not walk out with any service.
