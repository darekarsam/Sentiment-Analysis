4	Oh, Party City!!! You are so wonderful to me!This location not only boast a huge size but an amazing selections of whatever you need to throw an amazing party!I was tasked with picking up some "birthday supplies" for our office and boy oh boy was I excited when I walked in here! They had everything I need organized and perfectly categorized to make the perfect theme!I found balloons, confetti, wall hangers, etc and in every color you could imagine! I was like a kid in a candy store! All the employees here were very nice, and it was overall a wonderful experience! Can't wait for our next major event! Hopefully, they will send me shopping again!
3	This store can be a bit overwhelming at times with all of the selections. I spent about 10 minutes wandering around looking for streamers and was never asked if I needed help finding anything. I finally found the streamers, along with some other party supplies including Justin Beiber balloons for $0.13 (which made for some fun decorating :) ). You can find deals like that scattered around the store, great little finds that aren't really advertised. A good place for party supplies, however can be a bit pricier than Walmart, which is where I normally buy things like streamers and balloons.
