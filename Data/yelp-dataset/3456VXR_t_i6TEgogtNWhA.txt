5	Why it has taken me this long to write a review of Headlee Roofing, I cannot say.  They have been my company of choice for years.  Although they are usually busy, they make the time for even smaller jobs and always do it right and for a fair price.I have used Headlee roofing since 1994 and my parents used them before that.  We have never had a problem.  I have referred friends and co-workers to Headlee for years and have never heard a negative word from anyone who has used them.Truly, this is the best roofing company in the valley.
5	Wow!!!! I am not used to the level of customer service that Headlee roofing gave us.  Thet were superb. They welcomed me  up to the roof to look over their shoulder, answered all my questions regardless of how ill timed. When I raised minor isues , they bent over backwards  to satisfy my concerns.  I would recommend them to all my friends without reservation. People I don't like can find their own roofing company.
5	These guys are real pros. They came out and gave me an estimate right away. They did a great job with my roof for a little less than the other quotes. They were professional and polite. And they got the job done fast. I now have a great warranty with them. Thanks Headlee Roofing!
