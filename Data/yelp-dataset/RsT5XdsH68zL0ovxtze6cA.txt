1	In May 2014 I contacted Fineholme Letting to view a few properties to rent in Edinburgh City. Like most estate agents in Edinburgh they were impatient and rude over the phone. I had difficulty finding one of the properties because a skip had been placed directly outside its door obscuring the building number. When I phoned and asked them to confirm the address, they were rude once again. Margaret showed me about the property and although she clearly new her stuff, she had know knowledge of whether prospective tenants were able to park in the space directly behind the flat. Altogether an unpleasant experience.
