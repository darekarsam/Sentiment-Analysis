5	i'm not sure when i became intrigued with religious art, but it happened.this place caters more towards the church-going crowd, but has tons of cool vintage catholic memorabilia. rosaries, crosses, books etc. i even got some sweet steelers rosaries here.the store is run by the nicest nuns (or nun-like women), and i do my best to support them whenever possible. i am however right at the threshold of my collection being cool or creepy, so i'll need to walk that line carefully.
5	I live in California now, but a close friend and fellow student would head to this store every couple of weeks to check for new titles.  I don't know how they get such amazing theology books and in such abundance, but this is the place to go!  I miss the religious who worked the store. They were so very kind and helpful.  Their prices are quite reasonable.  Go check it out!
5	This store is wonderful, as are Sean and Sister Mary who work there. They are so warm and friendly, and I always am able to find great Catholic books and items here at a great price. I recommend coming in with a good amount of time on your hands because there is so much to see (lots of hidden treasures), but I have also walked in and out of the store within a few minutes when I have come into the store with a specific item or book in mind. Definitely worth a visit!
