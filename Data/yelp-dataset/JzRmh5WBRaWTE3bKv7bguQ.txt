5	I went in today the staff was so friendly and my therapist Anna was beyond amazing. She was able to work out some pretty major knots and tension in my back neck and shoulders and I feel much better!
5	Best massage I've had. The staff are amazing. The place smells beautiful, the atmosphere is so relaxing.  And they don't try to sell you useless products or coffee mugs. Love this place,  can't wait to go back!
