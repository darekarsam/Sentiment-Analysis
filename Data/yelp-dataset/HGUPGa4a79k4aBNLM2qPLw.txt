1	I only went in here once out of curiosity.  I'm mad at them for two reasons.  First, when my cousins the Knox's sold their property here where they lived when they were first married, it was under a stipulation the little house on the property not be torn down.  One day they got a call from friends who told them their house was being demolished and they didn't even have the chance to go take a few last pictures.  I used to always take a turn past that house when there on visits because on my first few trips to Chandler when I was in college, this is where I stayed.  Now it's the Dollar General--which turned out isn't even a true Dollar store (see explanation below)..Second, to me a dollar store is a place where everything should be a dollar--hence the name!  I got a bag of BBQ chips and didn't realize till I got home they charged me $3 for.  I wouldn't have bought them if I'd known that.  I intended to take them back and complain since they weren't marked so it was like I got tricked but I just never got back there.  When my brother came to town we just ate them.  I also never went back there so they lost business from me.  I love dollar stores and went to the 99 Cent Only Store in Chandler weekly--because I knew everything was 99 cents!
1	First time customer.  Everything was dusty on shelf.  Just nasty.  You can find better deals elsewhere.
5	I give this store five stars because they actually carry decent items and a good deal. Name brand face wash i usually purchase from Wal-Mart, i found here for half the price. Work shoes, for only 6$. And even home decor items. Oh, and their food selection is not too bad. Good brands.  Love this little company.
