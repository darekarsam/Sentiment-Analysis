3	An adorable little gem hidden on Fleury! I went there for a brunch. The place is small and I suggest to reserve as places are limited.  It is awesome how they serve cornbread straight out of the oven! The brunch menu is original and offers some interesting twists on classic! And for those carnivores loving to eat steak at breakfast, you will be oh so happy! I had a spiced bavette with a sunny side up, roasted potatoes and aioli! Oh my was that awesome! However, the service was flawed.  The waiter did not served us all at the same time and it took everything to have a cup of coffee or water!  Still, the food is definitely worth it!
