4	This place is great if you need some really good food on go.  Although I should say that the sandwiches can be a little messy sometimes, so maybe it's not so much an on- the- go food.  Either way, the food here is really tasty.  The bread is baked fresh and the meats and cheeses taste like the high quality stuff.  The people here are really nice and pretty quick too, which is nice.  Also this particular location shares space with another restaurant, so if you are with someone who wants something else to eat, you are covered.
3	If you want a great gyro for a cheap price this is your spot. The gyro is stuffed and it is a two fist-er wrap. The don't have french fries but they do have other sides to choose from but nothing for my taste. From the outside it looks as if this is a place with another restaurant option right next door, until you walk in. Then you'll see, both "restaurants" are one. You can order anything inside Steak and Hoagie including anything from "the other restaurant" menu all at the same counter. As a matter of fact the "other restaurant" Grecos menu, is where I ordered my gyro from. I got my $4.75 moneys worth in this gyro. So why am I leaving the review for Grecos menu here under Steak and Hoagie? Because that's the door I walked in and then out of. And, they used the Steak and Hoagie logo wrap for my Gyro.Confused yet?
4	Solid cheesesteak place with some pretty good hoagies as well.  A tad bit pricey, but damn good none the less.  My biggest recommendation is the Steak Au Jus.  That's right a delicious cheesesteak with onions and a cup of au jus to dip that bad boy in.  Absolute nummers my man, absolute nummers.
