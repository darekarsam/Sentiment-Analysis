4	mac salad is on point!! Huge menu. Tried the BBQ CHICKEN & chicken katsu... Good stuff... Coming back for sure.
5	This restaurant is absolutely awesome. The Yelp reviews and photos helped big time in choosing from the menu. The atmosphere is casual and friendly. The staff are helpful and patient. I ordered the BBQ Mixed Plate which was loaded with delicious BBQ meat and rice. This was enough for two! The garlic cheese fries were okay, just a tad bit greasy. The Chicken Katsu was awesome, we'll priced, and huge. I also recommend the ordering from the soup menu. I love this restaurant and can't wait to try something new each time. But I end up ordering the BBQ Mixed Plate.Note: There are two Yelp postings for the same business. This was my review.
4	My favorite Hawaiian BBQ spot in town. When I go I always get the BBQ Chicken plate and my girlfriend gets the kalua pork plate. Both come with rice and macaroni salad. We also like to get the punch drinks. The great thing about this spot is its very fast service....And they also deliver! So now we can stay at home and order lol. I recommend this to anyone who wants to try some good Hawaiian BBQ! The Best! Dine in area kinda small.-Joe
