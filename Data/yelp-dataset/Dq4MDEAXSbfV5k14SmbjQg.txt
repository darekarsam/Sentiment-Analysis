1	I like to support local businesses so, thought I would try this new salon since it is so near my home. Unfortunately, it was not a good experience and I want to inform others, so at least they know what they are dealing with. Wish I had known. The techs here are brand new nail school graduates with very little experience. It took nearly 3 hours for my tech to complete a pink and white full set and they look horrible! The white tips are of uneven length, some tips wide and others very thin. On some nails the white is swirled into the pink and looks really bad. After less than 2 weeks I have had 3 nails tips chip off and had to be filed down. The pink color is also uneven. I was going to call and have them redone, but what's the point? She obviously did the best job she could, but just does not have enough experience yet. I felt bad for her because she was obviously uncomfortable as well. Just needs more practice!My neighbor had the same experience a week later. It took her over 2 hours to do just a regular back fill with polish. She was not happy with how they turned out so went back the next day to have them redone. They still do not look great.I was hoping to find a great new nail salon location, but was extremely disappointed.
