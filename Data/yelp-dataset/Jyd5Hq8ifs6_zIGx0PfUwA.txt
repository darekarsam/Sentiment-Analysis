4	I love this place!  I took my car in for an oil change yesterday and the technician met me outside.  He took my car keys to start working on my car before I even stepped inside the place.  They had my car ready in record time and I was worried about the tire pressure and was inquiring if they were going to check on it for me, but the cashier told me he saw the tech put air in already.  The car and tires looked great!  There are discounts located on their website and I will keep going back!
5	Don't you just love cars ...that is, right up until something goes wrong with them. I feel exactly the same way. In fact, the feeling of sheer and utter dread overcomes me when I hear grinding noises coming from the front end of the car, despite my best attempts to keep up with rigorous maintenance schedules, oil changes, etc. Well, that was the case for me yesterday as I started to drive my car around sunny Scottsdale.The guys were really friendly and helpful. They found the problem quickly and provided me with a reasonable estimate of the repair costs. I called around a few other places and found their price hard to beat. They completed the job within the hour and called me on my cell phone to confirm my car was ready for pickup. Great service! No hassles!
5	This is my second time here. Very professional service and no hassle to get the work done. My favorite part about this place is that I don't have to worry about them trying to up sell me on services I don't need.  Being a female I have to say I've experienced the up sell in the past on multiple occasions. Luckily I know enough about cars to know when they are doing so. This is not a problem here at Midas. I really appreciate honesty and this place certainly meets my expectations. Thanks guys!! I will be back.
