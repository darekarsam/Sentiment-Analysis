3	It's a cute store, but I didn't see anything original or interesting that I haven't seen at Lush.  The ducky soaps are cute.  It has a "homemade" feel to the products, which doesn't quite match the price point.  Still, it smells good and the staff are nice.
5	Loova is a cute and interesting little shop mixed in with restaurants and bakeries in a plaza on Library road. There isn't much to say about the decor since the soaps and lotions are the main attraction here. The owner uses the back as a warehouse/factory to produce and create the homemade products for this store, the store at station square and other out of town locaions where their products are sold. The selection of bath and body products is quite extensive. It's hard to believe that the owner and her staff come up with the ideas for these products. My favorite had to be the kid's corner with ducky soaps and soaps with fish, turtles and other sea creatures "stuck" in them. There is also a wide selection of creative and fun bath products for adults as well. If you are looking for a unique, homemade gift idea, Loova is a good fit.
5	This is one of my favorite shops at Station Square!It has a really cute, home made vibe and the soaps smell FANTASTIC.  My favorite soap is the Cleopatra's Desire.  Or the Mint one.  I don't know.  They all smell really good.I also like their Bath Bombs which leave your skin very soft.Loova is also my go-to store for birthday gifts, they have a variety of baskets you can pick from, you pick out the items you want to go in the basket and they'll put it together for you.
