5	I never figured that a croissant sandwich labelled "vegetarian" would draw my attention. Wow was it packed with flavor!My first taste of "Fous" happened at the food truck gathering last friday. It was the first truck I ordered from since it was right by the entrance and there was no line up -perhaps it was the anticipation build up and my hunger that helped turn this 7$ croissant into of the one best light snacks I've ever had. Yes, it's pricey, although this is something I'd only have at special events. There's something fun about ordering from a truck!I was hoping they would serve up their classic ham or bacon creations but I opted for the mediterranean (sundried tomatoes, ricotta cheese, basil) which was a perfect mix. The croissant is nice and flakey on the outside, tender and buttery inside- Great blend of salty and sweet.I'm looking forward to trying more from their menu, this is a must if you're visiting the food truck event at the Olympic Stadium, I love how light and flavorful this is, leaving room for all the other trucks on my to-eat check list.Bonus: they take debit/credit cards.
