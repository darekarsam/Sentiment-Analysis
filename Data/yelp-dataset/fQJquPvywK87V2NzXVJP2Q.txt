3	Good authentic Mexican food.  La Palapa started at the Public Market and moved with the Public Market to this location.  The tamales are good with the homemade mole.  Nice flavor.  Only one tamale left so decided to have a taco with it.  Tacos are good too.  The menu is limited but some good Mexican food at a good price.  The server mentioned that La Palapa uses Clarion foods beef for the beef tacos.
5	Best tacos in Pittsburgh! I have tried their chicken, barbacoa, pulled pork, corned beef, and they are all so delicious! My favorite  is the potato and poblano pepper filling, which they have added to their permanent menu. A must try!!
5	Everything I try here is great! Seriously! Everything. I suggest the try 3 or the tamales, and if they have watermelon water, you MUST try it!
