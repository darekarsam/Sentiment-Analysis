1	Two girls working here on a saturday afternoon, they appeared to be sharing a brain as neither one of them was able to do anything by themself and kept having to ask for help. They definilty need better training on how to pack merchandise as certain things don't need to be perfect like unbreakable objects, yet they insist it has to be done per their standards which mean extrodenarly expensive. Its my merchandise and I am paying you to pack it the way I tell you to, you already sign a release of liability when you ship with them so why does it matter, just move your ass. I think the one girl, Kaylee I believe is her name, is either semi-retarded or just moves in slow motion. The manager needs to come in there and get things moving.
4	This was the first time I have ever come here.  I usually use the service pick up from home, but I missed my scheduled pick up.  I hate when I do that.  Anyhow, I had a couple of things that I needed to get out today and used this store.  Here is my review:- Parking = easy- I pack everything from home and print out my labels as well.  I'm an easy customer.- So, it was just a matter of getting to the front desk and completing the exchange.- I was in and out of there in no more than 10 min.If I ever miss a shipment from home; I'll come here as it is relatively close to home.  Plus I can pick up some food from China-a-go-go or pizza from Angelina's.
2	Well I needed something faxed there and my insurance company tried sending it like 8 times. It would start coming through and it would stop. The representative said he kept getting error. . Error ... and he said ask ups to restart the machine and the lady said the machine was fine that it been workin all day.  How hard is it to shut it off and turn it back on. It would of taken a few minutes and they would of made money.... lazy lazy workers
