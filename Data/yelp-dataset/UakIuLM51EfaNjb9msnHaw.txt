2	I could not believe they don't have Coconut Cream Frappuccino, I literally ordered that last summer many times. This time, the barista gave me a perplex look saying that they never serve that stuff.Alright, it's cool.I took the recommended Vanilla Bean instead, and it was just TOO sweet, unbearable.The place is messy and very noisy, not the best Starbucks I've had.
