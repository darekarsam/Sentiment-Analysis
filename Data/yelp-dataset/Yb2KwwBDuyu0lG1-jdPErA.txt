4	I would definitely recommend Coyote Plumbing.  I had another company offer a really pricey bid on what I thought was a simple job to fix my clogged sink.  My mom referred me to Coyote for another estimate and not only did they do the same job, just as effectively, just as friendly of a tech, but they charged me $200 less than the other guy's estimate.  Simple and painless, just how it should be!
5	Coyote Plumbing came out today to do some repairs and Cory did an excellent job. The price was so much lower than other plumbing companies. We have used Coyote for years and never had a complaint. I highly recommend them to anyone who wants quality work at a reasonable price. There are so many other companies out there that just try to rip you off with the price, but NOT Coyote.Carlene
5	We have used Coyote Plumbing for approximately a year.  They are fantastic!  We have what some would consider high expectations of great service at a reasonable price.  They have delivered over and over again.  Cory is always on time, professional, does a great job and is willing to go the extra mile.  Can't say enough good things about them!
