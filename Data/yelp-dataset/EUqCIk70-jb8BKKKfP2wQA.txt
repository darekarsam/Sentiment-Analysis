5	Wonderful. I had the best pate in my entire life and lots of adventurous dishes. It's worth every penny. Can't go wrong!
5	This place has continually impressed me with both the service and the food. The inventive french inspired menu uses fresh seasonal ingredients to create dishes rich in a myriad of flavors. Although this restaurant is on the pricey end like Bruno A said, its worth every penny. Make sure to make reservations, though it may seem out of the way to the local Montrealer it is a culinary destination for most foodies! If you love mushrooms every week there is a different mushroom special that is bound to impress and satisfy your palette. M sur Masson is a spa for my taste buds! Its a great getaway from the everyday meal!
3	Great place for a Sunday brunch. Their take on the grilled cheese is amazing.
5	There are very few times that you can honestly order your meat rare and not have to worry that it will be undercooked; this is one of the few restaurants that you can have faith in the chef. While the food is expensive, it is so finely prepared that you try to forget about the price and just enjoy the food.  Worth every penny. Each dish was expertly prepared and plated. The baguette on the table was incredibly fresh and crusty.  The service was very good and the atmosphere was nice. (Well, maybe the pews were a bit hard, but that's about all.)
5	Lovely, very lovely. A bit pricey for the neighborhood but immaculate. I had the smoked duck tartar, lovely complemented with pomegranate, along with the faux-filet. My spouse had the potato and cheddar soup as well as the veg "plat du moment," which today was a shroom risotto. All was delightful and we left the place stuffed. The dessert, a nice lemony creme brulee, was a delightful palate cleanser. A++
