1	The food was not good.  The owner sat at the bar and badgered the employees and customers. I ordered the stuffed mushroom and they were mushy and flavorless.   The "homemade" gnocchi was brutal.  I think they may have frozen it and recooked it.  I am not sure how they are still open.
3	This is a great little taste of Chicago in AZ.  The thin crust pizza is a good as many in Chicago.  The beef is a disappointment if you have had a Chicago Beef recently, it will work if want close to Chicago, but avoid if you want the real thing.  I am a regular at Jimmy's we go every Friday, we go three Friday's a month.  When we attended tonight we were told they were completely booked, when we asked to wait, we were told we are completely booked for tonight.  I have never experienced a restaurant that refused to tell me how long the wait was, but rather wanted me to leave.  I am waiting for the next table because I believe that as a regular who attends as frequently as I do, I at least should be told a time rather than encouraging me to leave.  Confused an waiting... At 20 minutes but still waiting... Will post again at the end of tonight's experience.
5	Great family owned place.  Wonderful atmosphere and service.  Great food.  Pizza is good. Their meat is great (sausage, meatballs, etc). Highly recommend their Italian Beef and Sausage Sandwich, or the homemade potato gnocchi with Vodka Sauce.
