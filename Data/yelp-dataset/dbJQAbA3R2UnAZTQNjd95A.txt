5	Awesome place....great location.  MUST see Tasha - master stylist and excels at color.  She is great with thick and curly hair and also picking out colors that correctly match your complexion. I would trust any suggestions she had on what to do...
4	New to the neighborhood I've been looking for a salon and this place is a winner. Perhaps not the stereotypical Scottsdale salon, which is a plus in my book and what attracted me Art of Urbanity Salon. The staff was friendly, the place was comfortable and my cut was great. Seeing this was my first time there, Kim did a great job making suggestions, making me feel comfortable, and I was not disappointed. Hair looked great! Josh who shampood and massaged was definitely entertaining and did a good job as well. Love that I have found a place I like, that does a great job and I can actually walk to from home. I'll be back!
5	Love the vibe of this place! Chill and relaxed. Always leave looking and feeling great. Aveda product line. Josh is a color genius!
