4	Good Pizza! Good customer service... well so far i havent ran into a rude employe(s) Lol that $10 for any size any topping any crust is a #Win btw (stuff crust $2extra)
2	I've been ordering here for years. Always had good experiences, except for tonight. The manager was extremely rude about me receiving cold pizza.  She definitely needs more training and needs to be kept off the phone!
