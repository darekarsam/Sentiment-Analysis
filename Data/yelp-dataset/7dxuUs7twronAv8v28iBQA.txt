5	London is an amazing photographer. She has been there for many of our life events and we enjoy watching our boys grow through her photographs. London is very relaxed and is willing to work with you and what you want. She normally out does my imagination in a great way!
5	London is very patient and easy going with the kiddos! She'll always find a way to make them smile and create a lifetime moment saved by a photo! :)
5	London is a amazing photographer. I'll always have pictures of my kids and family captured to look back on. Highly recommended and very prompt responses and work done.
