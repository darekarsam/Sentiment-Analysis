3	My wife and I paid a visit to Shangri La Ranch.  It looks overall okay.  We just were not ready for joining in the lifestyle of naturists.  We are not ready to do the clothing optional thing.  Not yet.  We still have our hangups.The people are friendly though.  The office people were more then happy to show us around.
4	I really enjoy this place. Very relaxed and friendly people. The ammenities aren't bad but the people are so very nice and genuine. Not a swingers club just a great place to relax and have fun naked. Try it you'll like it! I did.
4	I had a chance to make a day visit while on vacation in the area.  June is their slow season so I had a good chance to explore the property.  Bigger than I expected with a pair on nice nature trails.  The facilities are first rate with two excellent pools.  The property is well maintained.  They have many permanent site users, so a walk around the park is a real treat to see how the properties are adorned.  The staff was super friendly and welcoming. A summer visit would be a great opportunity to try out a nudist venue for a first timer.  They offer a free first visit.
