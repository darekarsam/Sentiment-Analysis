5	They replaced a large window; did a great job and didn't leave a mess for us to clean up.  They also matched our existing windows perfectly (with another brand).  The cost was exactly what we expected, and follow up was good.  We would use them again, without question.
5	Fantastic experience from start to finish! We replaced ALL of our windows and added a few new ones. Josh came out to do the estimate. He was on time and very helpful. There weren't any high-pressure sales tactics (like I experienced with the other two estimates I got from different companies). I went with Freelite because of the honest dealings with Josh. Guy and Matt came out to double-check measurements and were like a well-oiled machine. You could tell these guys had been in the business a long time. Window installation went really smoothly (for an old house). Guy and Matt were able to make on-site adjustments.  They were very professional, worked their tails off and cleaned up after their work. The final product is outstanding and we couldn't be happier.
