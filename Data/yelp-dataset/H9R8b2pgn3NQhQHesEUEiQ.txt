3	It's a used media store chain. Not to much to say about it. I usually shy away from these places because they run the independent stores out of business. I still stand by that but I gotta say that no matter which one of these I walk into, the people working here always know they're stuff and are really cool which makes me want to buy something from them. This one is no exception, I asked the guy if I could see something on the top shelf and the guy practically ran to the back room to get a ladder, now that's service!  I still have to knock some stars off for the low trade in value they give and the fact that their prices on some stuff is pretty steep for used. Still, the employees rock!
