2	Buying flowers online for delivery has been so disappointing.  I went ahead and tried out a new florist , that being Harlold's Flowers shop and sadly I made my first and last purchase here this weekend. For 60 dollars I got an arrangement of mostly sticks and greenery with some light green hydrangea and gerbera daisies there were mostly sticks, regular sticks.  I purchased flowers for myself to decorate my living room and spruce things up for spring and I wish I hadn't.  I have never had an arrangement of flowers where there were sticks as part of the arrangement, let alone to focal point of the arrangement. Moving forward and floral purchases I will make, will have to be done in store.  Ordering arrangements online is just not cutting it. My expectations weren't too high to begin with.  The reason I even tried this place out was because they do a weekly arrangement for the lobby of the building that I work in.  I have been impressed with the height and attention to detail.  Perhaps the person who makes the arrangements for the USX Tower lobby is off on the weekends.
3	I was so excited to send flowers to a girlfriend of mine staying in Pittsburgh for a few months. I guess they arrived at her door in a plastic trash bag. Nobody thought to take them out of the bag before presenting them to a birthday girl!
5	I ordered flowers to be delivered tomorrow and then went on the online chat today to see if they could be delivered today and they accommodated my request. Couldn't be happier!
