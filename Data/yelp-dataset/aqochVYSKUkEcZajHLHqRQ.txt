5	I'm salivating just thinking about this place! So i'm keeping this short and to the point. Food is DELICIOUS, everything my boyfriend and I have tried was great. BEST Imperial Rolls in Mtl that either of us has had. The food is all super tasty and filling, but doesn't leave you feeling disgustingly full after, it's all light and fresh! Service is very friendly, i've never had to wait too long for my food, the restaurant itself is clean and modern looking, and best of all it's all at a great price! :)
5	really good pad thai!
1	The food was just meh. We had Pad Thai. However there was no tofu, and we thought that they didn't make it with authentic noodles. Plus the chicken tasted like BBQ chicken and there were very little peanuts. None of the ingredients were really correct. The service was quite slow. I.e. We had to get up to ask for more water. And the server slammed down our plates, without taking the appetizer plates first. To top it off, the table was sticky. :(
