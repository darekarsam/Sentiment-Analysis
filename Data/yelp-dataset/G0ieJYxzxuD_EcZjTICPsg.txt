5	As good as it gets for a Taco Hell... The cashier, Lani, who served us even knew how to do basic math in her head!!!  It's really sad when you are impressed that a cashier can do this at a fast food place, but good for Lani for not following the register and giving my friend $206,000 when the register created an error for itself. :)  She didn't even pull out a calculator. :)But that would have been a great win on the way to Vegas.Lani was friendly and took control of it all with a smile. :)  It was great... she said, "It's fast food, not rocket science". I had to die laughing when I heard that one. :)Bathroom was clean and everything was well stocked.
5	Everyone knows about the good food.This one had good management as well
5	Ok...it's Taco Bell...you know what to expect, but this location had great service, a wonderful drink selection (Manzanita Sol!), fresh food...left happy.
5	The service provided by this location has improved so much from previous years. Also the food is great. Better than most Taco Bell locations. Good job guys!
5	Love Taco bell. Not much more to say. Great food, great service, and management is very nice. Anyone and everyone should go here(and they have some vegiterian options like beam burritos and cheese quesadillas.)
5	Had a very cool experience at Taco Bell drive-thru. The food was good, fast service, and friendly drive-thru staff.
