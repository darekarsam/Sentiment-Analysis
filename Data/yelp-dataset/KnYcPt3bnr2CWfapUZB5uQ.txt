5	Brittany does an amazing job! I am such a slacker and never get my hair cut "regularly" like I should. That doesnt matter though because Brittany takes the time to do a detailed cut that lasts. I didnt even have to tell her the first time I saw her about my annoying natural part. Any other hairstylist I have ever seen automatically parts my hair down the middle and cuts my hair using that part as a guide. It doesnt work out good when I get home and do my own hair. Brittany automatically noticed that my hair parts on the side and knew just what to do about it. Last time I saw her I decided to change things up and add some color. Usually I avoid it because im too much of a slacker and know that it will eventually look terrible because I wont keep up on it. After chatting with Brittany about it I decided to go with some bright red peek a boos. This was over 6 weeks ago and it still looks good! I cant wait to go back and try something a little less "safe"!!Keep up the great work Brittany!!
5	I would never switch to anyone else in the entire Phoenix Metro!  Brittany is amazing - knows hair, hair color, and products!  She has a darling location in downtown Chandler in a really fun atmosphere. How I lucked out and found her when I first moved to Arizona,  I will never know, but I know I am blessed!  Try her out - you will not be disappointed!!
5	Britt is AMAZING! I love her work! My hair was a HOT MESS before seeing her and she has done miracles! She has become not only my hair stylist but someone j have grown very close too. She takes interest in her clients and their well being. Her work is amazing. She has helping my hair grow from chin length to the middle of my back in three years (when my hair doesn't grow at all for health reasons!) she is a dream worker! She is the only person who touched my hair! And her prices are VERY reasonable! Go see her for yourself and say Bree sent you! :)
