4	This Costco Gas & Diesel, is easy in... easy out.Over the past few weeks I've hit a few Costco Gas stations in several different states.  Surprisingly, most of these Costco service stations are conveniently located near most on/off ramps of major Freeways. This one is less than a mile from the 101/FLW. So it's almost as easy as the dedicated stations along those interstates. It only requires a little planning ahead of time. LOLThat said, this Costco is near our house.  It is slightly more expensive than the other locations in the Valley, such as Paradise Valley Mall, and Phoenix. But when compared to other gas stations in the area, well... there is no comparison.  Besides getting gas here, as you drive out on the left you can get your car washed.  Nice!

4	Fast and easy, payments can be paid by debit cards, AMEX cards, or Costco cash cards.  No cash or checks allowed.  Great price too!
3	I like this Costco gasoline station-- not all gasoline stations are equipped with pumps that can accomodate both sides of a car.  I learned this lesson a long time ago, but decided to add it on here, since it is a rare thing.  $1.999 per gallon for unleaded is the lowest I've seen (or was it $1.799?).  Not as low as what my sister has seen in a non-Costco station in Texas, though.
