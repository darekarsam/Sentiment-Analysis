4	If you are looking to find furniture that may have some imperfections, but the price is good.  Come here.  You're going to have to look around cause it ain't all great. I found a nice lamp for half price.  Give it a look.  You've got nothing to loose.
3	Moving to a new apartment and shopping for furniture. Checked out the Rooms to Go Clearance. Large facility. Lots of materials being sold at discounted prices because they are scratched, some glass table missing glass pieces, one has to really shop an look closely at the products. There are good merchandise too maybe from a floor sample or another season. If you want less flaws then definitely go to the rooms to go showrooms.
