1	Took my dog there after a friend referred. Poor little guy has razor rash around his eyes and under his jaw. The owner told me his skin was dry and suggested I take him to the vet for a cortisone shot. After three days with no shot his "dry skin" is getting better by the day. Very disappointed.
5	I have been taking my dog to Samy's for the past three years now.  He has always done an excellent job of grooming her.  She always comes home with cute little bows on her ears and she smells so lovely.  He charges so little compared to other grooming services in Las Vegas, but the quality of the service is right on par with the rest.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.
4	I always get in right away. My dogs smell great and look cute and happy after they are done. I brought them to a big box store one weekend for grooming, I will not make that mistake again. I can wait the weekend for Samy.
4	We have been taking our pekingese to Samy for four years. Samy's shop always does a great job cutting his hair.
