1	The layout of this urban outfiiters is awful. It's really hard to shop in. Head office should have a look and completely re-do the interior. The girls section is SUUUPER small and the staff do not keep the clothing organized. It was so disorganized it was difficult to find the clothes and sizes beacuse clothes and styles were just everywhere and sprawled out. It was a horrible nightmare of shopping trying to navigate their sale section. The apartment section took up most of the store which really confused me because it was quite spread out on the second floor. I was jealous of the guys section beacuse it was the nicest most organized part of the store.
2	Urban Outfitters is a clothing store for both men and women. The clothes here are trendy, unique and stylish. You can find dresses, blazers, jeans, sweaters, blouses, vintage style clothes, bags, accessories, swim wear, cute pillows and candle holders for home etc.This particular location was the worst Urban Outfitters I've ever been too! Upon walking in, I noticed that there was hardly anyone working there; I didn't even see anyone behind the cash. There were racks of unorganized clothes and bins of accessories. The store was somewhat dimmed lighted which made it hard to see anything in the store. The messiness and lack of organization made it really hard to shop here. Also, some of the clothes had some threads sticking out of them and the price for the merchandize is somewhat high. For example, a plain off the shoulder sweater was $58, and it didn't even look nice.I won't be back here again. They're other better places for one to shop for stylish clothes.
3	Location-wise it's a good location, the staff is usually friendly and the selection is pretty good. Although the sales section tends to be more expensive for the same things than other Urban outfitters I have been to.
