5	Steve Fox might possibly be the best bartender in Las Vegas. Great jokes and conversation. Very attentive. Might have to make this place a regular stop on the way home.
5	Driving up at night, didn't think much of the place. When we got inside the bar was surprisingly nice.  The bartender on shift greeted us very nicely! We were very pleased with the service we got. Thanks again Garrett! We will be back soon.
5	This place is pretty quiet most of the time but should be the busiest bar in Las Vegas! Its big, clean, and friendly. Great drinks and loose machines. The staff has always been friendly, professional, and pour a great drink. The recent addition of Garrett to the staff has been amazing! He is warm, friendly, and genuinely cares about your experience. He will keep you coming back time and again! I would recommend calling to see when he is there. You will be happy you did!
