4	Great place for sports equipment, especially bikes and hockey. Been going there for years. Cheers!
4	I'm a fan of this sport place because they have everything. And by everything, I mean almost everything: the only thing they might lack are equipment for martial arts (maybe they do have it in the back store and I just don't know it!).Anyway, yes, it is a bit pricier than Sport Experts and big Sports stores, but the people there know their stuffs, and they are very polite. I like it a lot. I prefer to pay for good quality products (clothes, jackets and winter coats, bike equipment...) but they do have the good brands that are top quality for each sport.
1	I have purchased two bikes here.  The products are great but the service isn't.  The bike mechanics are generally not very knowledgeable, and the head  mechanic never actually listens to what you have to say.I had my bike serviced under warranty.  I was promised a turnaround time of 3 to 4 weeks but instead had to wait 3 months.  When I received the bike back it was delivered with flat tires, and improperly adjusted brakes and gears making it un-ride-able.  Under further inspection there were various bolts and washers missing, and the crank spindle was installed without grease when it should have been.Further I was assured by the store's owner that everything that it went in for was fixed, however only a portion of the tings were fixed.
