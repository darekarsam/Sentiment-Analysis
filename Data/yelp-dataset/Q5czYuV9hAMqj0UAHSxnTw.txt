4	Great people! Fun atmosphere! And best of all is the people that work there. Great service with a sense of humor! And really good grub! Definitely a place I don't want you to come to! Cus  it's a place that should be a secret. So please stay away! Lol
5	Awesome place! Many a great nite at old Scoundrels! Cheese steaks are the bomb! Fun atmosphere and great gaming. 3 pool tables and 3 dart boards. As well at golden tee and big buck hunter! Lots of fun, food and drinks to be had at this little north side gem!
1	WOW our first time here and no bowl game  specials. kitchen help comes out and blows cigarette smoke all over us while we are in the corner away from everyone else.  Happy hour is a whole .75 cent savings on a beer.  woohoo.  no going to be back here again.
