5	Excellent plumbing service! Called late Saturday scheduled for Sunday. Called 30 minutes prior to appt as stated. Arrived on time and fixed my problem in fifteen minutes. The crappy Home Depot captured nut puller failed and I could not get the nuts off the copper pipes. His puller pulled them quickly and he installed the new valves and hoses while he was in there. 90 dollar base for a visit. Paid 90.
1	What a joke. First day I wait, the guy finally called me and told me he couldn't be there in the quoted time, so I rescheduled for the next day. I never got a call the next day so I called and the guy didn't even have me in the books, and told me he'd be here an hour and a half after my quoted time! I told him to cancel and he hung up on me!
1	They scheduled a service call between noon and 1.00.  I called them at 3.30 asking if they were still coming.  Excuses about scheduling issues and a promise to call me back in 5 minutes. That was the last I heard from them. Absolutely can't depend on them.
