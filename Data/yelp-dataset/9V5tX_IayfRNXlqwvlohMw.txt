5	Valley View Pest Control is great! They were prompt, professional, and took care of our cockroach problem. I would recommend them to all my Vegas friends and family!
5	Dan from Valley View Pest Control first came to my house about a year ago, when I started seeing bugs in my house.  He and Julie give great customer service, are proactive about knowing what the houses around me are seeing in terms of pest and treating my house accordingly even if I haven't seen those pests outside yet.  Which I almost never do, since the treatments have been effective.  Dan even gave my husband recommendations on how to treat a pest problem he encountered while working out of state.  I recommend them to all of my friends and family.
5	I don't live in Las Vegas anymore but when I did, I used Valley View Pest Control for years. They are awesome. Dan is professional, prompt, and the prices are very reasonable. I never had any issues with this company and their services kept the crazy bugs at bay!
5	We love Valley View Pest Control. Thank you for keeping us pest free and for your great family owned service. We always recommend you to friends and family.
