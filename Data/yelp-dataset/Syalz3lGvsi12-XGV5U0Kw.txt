2	I gave this place an extra star just because of the stories I now have to tell people after visiting.  Honestly, I don't even know where to begin, so I guess I'll start with some background information.I was visiting Charlotte for business and on my last night there I decided to go out.  I met a few people earlier in the night and as the evening progressed (and as we drank more) we all decided it would be appropriate to go to the strip club.We arrived about an hour before they closed and I persuaded the guy at the door to let us for half price.  He wrote down all of our driver's license numbers and then let us enter (they do this for all guests).  There were no dancers on stage and I never really saw anyone that was hot enough to be a stripper.  There was one sleazy (I mean, really sleazy) kid that had on a gold thong under his shorts, so I assume he worked there.This place is surreal.  Loud music, extremely smoky, and furniture that looks like it was purchased in the kitchen section at Big Lots.  There really isn't anything else that I can say...

There were also some dancers who needed to spend some more time practicing in front of the mirror, but for the most part it was a GREAT time! The club was clean, and everyone was very friendly! The drinks were a good price, and the music kept the party going. I went there with little expectations, and left thoroughly impressed! I wish I had more stars and more money to spend in this bar! I will definitely be back! Chasers and Charlotte's best kept secret!
