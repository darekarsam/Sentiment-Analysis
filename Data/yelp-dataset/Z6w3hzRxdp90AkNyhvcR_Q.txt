3	I was happy to find a good dry cleaner upon recently moving to the Charlotte area. I felt that they were a bit overpriced, but they totally got the job done and had my clothes ready when requested. I had to visit their location in Ballantyne to have my dress altered, but they did a great job and I would totally go back. There are plenty of locations around the Charlotte area and they all seem to be great.
