4	Great Pizza, Great Price, Great People.From street view this family owned pizza shop would not have been my fist choice, but I was being treated so I did not object. The white pizza was really good, I couldn't get enough. The seats were not very comfy and the decor is nothing to write about, but they made up for it with their service!
4	I'm more than a little wary of cheap ny-style pizza.  I've made my way through a few different Lawrenceville spots and mostly felt pretty underwhelmed.  Greasy and boring seemed to be the trend, but I was very surprised by how I just couldn't stop eating the large cheese we got from Supreme Pizza!  I think it's the crust, super tasty, chewy, delicious.  I'm looking forward to going back.
