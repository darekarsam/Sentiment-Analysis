5	I've been coming to this gurudwara for almost a year and a half now. I never knew they were on yelp. I hope it's not bad karma to rate your religious center, so here's hopin'!! For those of you who may not know, this is the holy center for those of us of the Sikh faith. You do not have to be Sikh to visit. Anyone is welcome (there's free food!) The only thing is you must cover your head and take off your shoes. I'm happy to have found this gurudwara in Las Vegas!!
5	If it wasn't for yelp i would never knew that there is a Gurudwara Sahib in Las Vegas area. Beautiful Building and open to all regardless of gender and race. i uploaded few pictures i hope you guys like them.  This place is 20-25 minutes away from Las Vegas Strip. There is another Sikh Temple which is very close to the Las Vegas airport.
5	I am planning to visit this place on 3rd week of September 2014 when coming to Las Vegas for company meetings.
