5	Friendly people, awesome food!
5	Was greeted as soon as I walked in by the guy making the hot dogs. Great value!  The hot dog was delicious and was only $2.99-3.99!Apparently a hot dog store from Detroit.
3	We got a Groupon to use while we were visitng over Thanksgiving.  The two things I didn't like is that you can't do your own condiments and the fries aren't listed separately so I didn't even see them until we were leaving because they are listed in the middle of the entire menu.I got the hot link and it was really good but I didn't like the chopped onions or relish. My son liked his regular hot dog but I wasn't impressed with the bite I tried.My mom and  my sister didn't really like their items (polish and a chili dog).
