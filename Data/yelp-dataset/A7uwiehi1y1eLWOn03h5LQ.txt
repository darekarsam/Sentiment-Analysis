4	I love the convince of the place and the price for a adjustments can't be beat.  I love that they give me a full adjustment you know legs, hips, shoulders, toes etc.
4	Sorted me out in a hurry.. Great place and friendly staff!
3	The positives: 1) No appointment needed 2) Even with a few people ahead, you don't have to wait long3) Nice Atmosphere4) Good value for serviceNegative:1) turnoverThe only negative aspect of these type of places is staff turnover. It is akin to Massage Envy. Just when you find someone that is really great, they up and leave. Other than that, It is A-OK.
5	I have been adjusted by two different docs here. Both have been very good. They listen to my concerns and modify treatment accordingly. Reception staff is always polite.
5	The Joint is a great place for routine adjustments. The front desk personal is extremely friendly and the doctors are great.
5	What I like about the place is that you don't have to pay for a bunch of X-rays before getting adjusted!  Also - I like that you can run in w/o an appointment when you're in the area.  Fast, easy and good priced!
4	After going to a salesman/chiropractor who completely turned me off to chiropractic therapy I went to The Joint. Still very skeptical, I asked a lot of questions based on my first experience and I felt like I was being taken care of rather than being taken to the cleaners. - Great Consultative Approach- Effective Treatment - Great Customer Service
4	The Joint is really great! For anyone who needs regular adjustments, this place can't be beat. it's only $49 for for adjustments a month and you can use them at any location. Like all doctors, chiropractors are all different and have different techniques so feel free to visit different locations and find out who is right for you.
