1	ARRRGGGGHHHHH! When Restaurant John's closed and was taken over by other folk there was much mourning. But I thought, as friends were going there for brunch, I'd join them and see how it was doing several months after the take-over. My friends waited more than 40 minutes for their food. I waited 30 minutes for 2 eggs over easy and sausage. The baked beans were dreadful. The toast was almost cold. There were 4, count 'em, 4 one inch by one inch pieces of melon as "fruit". The comfy banquettes have been ripped out for hard chairs and everything is brown - dark brown-  including the dying plant in the corner. JUST what I want to see while eating. The presentation was dreadful, even for a casse-croute. The "waitress" was invisible and some poor creature kept coming around every 5 minutes asking us if we wanted more coffee or water BUT she couldn't take our order or do anything else.  The place, which used to be jumping on a Saturday, was almost deserted. Another couple nearly walked out because their food was so late. No wonder the place was empty.Stay away from this disaster and remember the good days of the real John's.
4	The birth pains with the change of ownership seem over. The food is good, arrived quickly, the service is pleasant and attentive. The beans have changed- they use spicy barbeque sauce, but I prefer this to the old style. The place is still busy, and I miss the old booths, but the switch to tables gives more space. I'm back to being a regular, but my comments were back on previous Yelp entries for the old version.
2	The upgrade to 2.0 failed. The breakfast  is unremarkable, as is the ambiance.
1	They have burnt down. Shortly after a new breakfast place opened up across the street from them, surprise surprise, there was a fire in the kitchen and the place is a smoking wreck. Ran into the original owner and he was heartbroken as he had sold the place to these hipsters as they said they would maintain the "good name and tradition" of the place.
