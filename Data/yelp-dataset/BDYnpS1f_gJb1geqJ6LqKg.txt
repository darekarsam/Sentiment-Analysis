2	I've never been a fan of this location. It's a little dirty. And when you're handeling food I expect more. If you can't scrub the front of house you're probably not cleaning the kitchen and food preparation area.
3	Meal: CoffeeRationale: After brunch at L'Avenue, we needed to find a wi-fi spot to plan our next move. Second Cup was a few doors down. We also felt obligated to try what seemed almost as prevalent as Starbucks.Food: I had a decaf Americano. Nothing special, as I expected.Service/atmosphere: Utilitarian. Fine. Wi-fi. One thing I bristled at was the sign that said "restrooms are for paying customers after consumption." They won't let you use the restroom until they can guarantee that you'll be flushing some of their product down, but anyone within a 30-metre radius can steal the wi-fi. Does not compute.Conclusion: Do you need coffee? Do you need wi-fi? Do you need the restroom? You can get at least two of these things at Second Cup.
3	I always think of Second Cup as a slightly Canadian Starbucks. It's just about the same, except their iced lattes have a bit more of an espresso punch to them.Nothing special about this location. If there's even a hint of sunshine, the outdoor patio will be packed with singles doing work or reading.
4	I'm that person who camps out at the coffee shop for 4, 6 hours at a time behind my computer. So this cafe fills a few important niches: 1) copious seating. You can sit in cozy chairs, or at a table, or at the bar. 2) wifi - endlessly. It refreshes every 2 hours, but just keeps on coming.3) caffeine. I only get the coffee. It's decent. Pastries are really lacking.4) lots of power outlets. Like tons. It's great.Some extra bonuses - interesting artwork on the walls (changes occasionally), a big outdoor patio in nicer weather, and convenient location. Good for me.
3	You want coffee? They sell it. You're hungry? They can make it. A bit pricey but it's worth a quite bite and coffee if you're on the run.
