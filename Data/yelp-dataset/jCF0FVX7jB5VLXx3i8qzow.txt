1	Pathetic.I reserved a car weeks ago and called to pick it up, only to find they'd given the car away because I was "late".  Thanks so much for the help.  And this was a full-size rental for an eight day trip.   A bunch of clowns sitting in an office with their thumbs in their ears.
4	When the Jeep got hit, USAA sent me to Enterprise for my rental car. The Oakland Enterprise employees were organized, friendly, and accommodating. Picking up & dropping off was a breeze. They even gave me a ride to the body shop once the Jeep was all fixed. Easy peasy!
1	Was quoted a much lower price for a car rental by the end if the whole ordeal I ended up paying $400+ for a $200 car. Brought the car back spotless(washed twice and vacuumed etc.) And they still kept $70 of my promised $250 return. Never again.
5	Staff is nice and the price is fair. Car condition is superior.
2	Reserved a car and checked to make sure it was OK if I arrived a bit later than the reservation time. Arrived to get the car and was told that they had given away the reservation.The woman who spoke with me was nice and told me she'd put in my name in case something opens up, but it was fairly obvious that she didn't want to be there and didn't really care about me.It would be nice if they 1) didn't supply false information, and 2) called to make sure I was picking up the reservation before they gave it away.Unfortunately, you don't really have any other options. This is just another example of a business that will always get business no matter what kind of service they give; it's virtually useless to comment on their service, and all this review does is fulfill a selfish need to be heard.
