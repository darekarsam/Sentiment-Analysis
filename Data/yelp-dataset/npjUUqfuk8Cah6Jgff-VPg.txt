1	Staff doesn't seem to care if you show up or not. Not very friendly. Have seen them let kids play unattended. Will not take my son back.
5	My 4-year-old son has been in the preschool program for 3 months now, and he loves it! We started going here because of sheer convenience (less than a minute away from home), as a way for him to burn off steam as he is extremely active. This is one of the only programs I know of that offers afternoon preschool from 1-5 pm, which is when he is at his most energetic. Not only is he having a blast and meeting great friends, but the staff is also wonderful and he is truly learning his letters and numbers.
