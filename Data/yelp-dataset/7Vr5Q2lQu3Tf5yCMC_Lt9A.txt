5	Love this new nightclub in the East Valley!!! We finally have a place for us, that is both classy and has great live R&B music. I recommend also eating dinner, and drinks are both very good. But the music is what makes this place some place you want to come back!!  Can't wait to check it out again next Saturday, just be sure to where nice attire because they do have a dress code.
5	Great music, love the R&B plus the live bands were a plus for me. the music took me back, good old school and mixed with new songs. food was delicious and drinks were amazing. I loved the crowd of people as well. Everyone there was mature, it was just an all around great experience.
5	HOT SPOT!!!!!! R&B music, with both live band and DJ, GREAT food and strong drinks. For the grown and classy crowd, all the songs we love from back in the day!!!!!
5	This is the place to go to on a Saturday night!
1	First time at this club and I hear crickets. Where is everybody tonight?  Complete waste of time except for the crew I'm with.  Might give it another shot some other time:(
