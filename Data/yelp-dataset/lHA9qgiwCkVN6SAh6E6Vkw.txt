5	Ashely is great. She's the only person I trust with my hair she knows how to make me beautiful and blonde! I wouldn't go to anyone else except her. She's fabulous :)
5	Just go my hair done by her today and I can't stop touching it. Even my dad loves it, which is a shocker! She came up with a whole new idea and I ran with it. Thank god I did because I couldn't be happier. She's amazing and very polite and great people skills. I've already hooked my friend up with her from outta town. I can't wait to go back again to her
5	Ashley did a great job on my hair! I have long thick and curly hair that makes most stylists shake in their smocks but Ashley handled my hair like a pro. She was incredibly patient and professional. Will definitely go back!
5	When I had my hair cut and colored by Ashley  I could not believe what a beautiful change I experienced from the beautiful color she made my hair to the WONDERFUL HEAD MASSAGE that alone will always keep me coming back.  Ashley is not like any other stylist she is very pleasant and  you never hear her complain about anyone or anything like some stylists I have been to. What a pleasant experience and I would highly recommend her.
5	Ashley is very professional. She is the only one who has ever done my hair the way I want it. She gives the best head massages ever.  This young lady can not only do my hair very well but, is also the sweetest girl. She listens to what you want and is honest when something can't be done.  If you're looking for an amazing stylist and someone that really knows color she is your girl.
