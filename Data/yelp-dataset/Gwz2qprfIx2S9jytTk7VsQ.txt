3	NOTICE: This review is for Happy Hour ONLY! One day I was going to meet a friend half way between our offices. Applebees was the easiest place to find in the area, so we decided to roll the dice and meet there for a quick after work drink.Their beer is 1/2 off during afterwork Happy Hour. So, if an American draft hits the spot for you and you want to spend around $2.50 on it, swing on by.
3	Food= Yuck.Service= Not stellar what so everOnly thing i do love here is their happy hours Half off drinks!!!L O V E   I T!!!If i were to go out for a girls night or something i would come here before going anywhere honestly...Only other fun place for happy hours is Devils Advocate Thursday Nights or BJS& Kona Tuesday Nights!
