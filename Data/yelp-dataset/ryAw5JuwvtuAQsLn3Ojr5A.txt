4	I thought this place was a pretty good gym.  Or maybe I am just really out of shape because I certainly got a good run for my free class!  First class is free and it was fun though.  The guy was a intense, but not too intimidating especially since I haven't gone boxing for like 2 years haha!  Definitely coming back!  They have student rates during the school year, which I don't understand why it's not for the whole year, but whatever, still a good deal.
5	The staff and trainers are AWESOME!  My Wife and I joined just recently and together and it's been great! The classes and workout  without question, kicks your hide! I'm hoping they add an earlier class in the fall at 4:30am or 5:00am for the early risers. So worth every minute and penny. You get out of it, what you put into it.
5	I love this place.  I started coming here in March and haven't stopped.  Each time I know I put my all into the workout and didn't just skate by.  All of the instructors are great and friendly, especially with helping you correct your form.  If you're looking for an easy workout, this isn't it.  If you want to work hard and feel a difference, look no further.
3	I started with this club a year ago through a groupon. The workouts are great, the trainers are amazing, and results will be seen. But make sure to get everything in writing (contract wise and each communication) and stay on top of the front desk staff with your account. Leaving my contract (due to moving) has been a real pain. The lack of communication is what drops this place 2 stars. It is really frustrating dealing with issues that you thought were resolved.
