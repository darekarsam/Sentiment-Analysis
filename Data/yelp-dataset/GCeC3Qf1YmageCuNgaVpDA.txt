5	AMAZING service by the lady at the information desk....so sad that I wasn't able to catch her name :(She spent over 15 minutes looking up to make sure I got the right library card and explained the differences and benefits of the one that I got. I live in a new part of town and wasn't coming up on her system so she called two different places to get the info.Then she went over all of the locations, found the one closest to me, and gave me the lay out of the library. She also made sure that I knew what the fines were for overdue books/dvd's so I wouldn't have to pay anything ;) Now about this library, it is right off a busy street and I guess the shopping center that it's located in is pretty popular because parking was hard to find! The library is well maintained and seems fairly new! There is a pretty hardcore DVD selection and there are some actual movies that are fairly new (past 2 years)..... among all of the national geographic documentaries of course ;) I got some yoga DVD's and a great book on healing the body through food! Just goes to show you that they have a great variety of material in their system!
