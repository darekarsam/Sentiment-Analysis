5	A lot of selection from mini cupcakes to whole pies. Beverages are on the menu also! You can come here and find anything to stop your sweet tooth!
5	I really like this bakery. We've been twice and were very impressed both times. The mother was working the register each time, and she remembered us. She is very friendly and sweet. The cupcakes really are delicious. This evening I had a spiced vanilla cupcake with an orange cream cheese frosting and it was very good. I'm not typically a cream cheese frosting fan, but this one was less tangy than most and had a wonderful hint of orange. My husband had the grasshopper pie (also super) and my girls each had a chocolate sour cream cupcake that they readily ate before I could ask for a bite.This is a hidden gem in Matthews, near Party City and across the parking lot from Wal-Mart. A true bakery was something that I always thought Matthews was lacking...until now. It's great to pop in for a little dessert and help support a local business. Give it a try!
3	I stumbled upon this bakery/coffee shop after passing it multiple times. The space is welcoming with a comfy looking sofa and chairs.  I don't know, when I arrived after 6:00 PM, the selection was minimal. The large cupcakes were priced at $2.75; the small ones were $1.50. 90% of the available cupcakes had a filling.  My daughter had chocolate with peanut butter filling.  She enjoyed it. I shared a small cinnamon bun cupcake and pink-colored cupcake with white icing that reminded me of birthday cake ice cream. When you take more than one bite and the sugar starts flowing, your mind tells you to eat more! I will try this bakery/coffee shop again one morning. I hope to find more items available and enjoy a good cup of coffee.
