4	Excellently friendly staff made it very easy to book appointment (which you need) and know all the prices very quickly.  Appointment started on time and went pretty fast.  Only complaint is the aesthetics.  TV that didn't work while you are waiting, Dusty signs and furniture and an ugly curtain half covering a storage room that anyone waiting can plainly see.
1	The worst customer service in the world . This a large conglomerate of Optometrists that staff all the eye masters locations in town too. If you have been to eye masters it's like a cattle call.Hurry you through your appointment so they can sell you their OH So overpriced glasses.Billing,whoa be very upfront with questions as to what is covered and what is not in your exam.Even though I did ask questions I STILL got the usual unpleasant surprises.Then trying to get it explained to you,HA. These people lie and use runaround tactics more than a politician does. I say Find a true independent Dr. that will actually take their time and care for your eyes rather than this group who is only concerned with how much they can nail you and your insurance for.
5	I recently received an eye examination at this location & I recommend them to anyone who needs one for their self. I especially would recommend getting the retinal eye exam in place of the traditional eye drops. Not only does it not cloud your day from having received drops, it gives you a view of your eyes that you've never seen before!
5	Friendly and engaging staff makes the process more pleasant
5	Dr Michelle T Chen was extremely helpful and courteous. In addition to being very professional and concise with the single vision exam I had, she was also very personable.  I personally recommend anyone interested in getting a vision specialist to think of her!Thanks Dr. Chen!
