4	This shop is on the waterfront in Old Montreal and I stopped in to get something for my hubby since it was his birthday. Whimsically decorated mugs and teapots,  clocks,  jewelry, scarfs, dishes, sundry items, bags, very large selections. He wasn't interested in anything in the store, but I bought a lovely pashmina for myself.  He, being the great guy that he is, told me to get one in all the colors.  I restrained my self and only got one. I would have taken a teapot set, it was so colorful, but realized that our one bedroom apartment in New York City was already chock full. C'est la vie!
4	The food was delicious - we shared melted Brie, pizza and nachos. The wine was great too. The atmosphere: marvelous. But the service was very slow, although quite nice.
5	Just happened to find this place as a refuge from the rain and snow today. Thank goodness! It was great! We shared nachos and Mac n cheese. Both were great and the atmosphere is wonderful. Sitting by the window overlooking the street was lovely. Their claim for the best coffee was true! I have been travelling the USA for 6 weeks and the coffee is terrible.... BUT here it was fantastic!!! At last great coffee!!! Service was fine and atmosphere great with quaint store next door.
5	What a great little place! The store is filled with cute unique things that are one of a kind and the cafe is very nice with great food. Me and my friend had butternut squash soup which was amazing and Mac and cheese which was great. It was the perfect snow day lunch! A must go
