5	Amazing place to take your child to swim,We started when our daughter was 10  months and I was nervous about her going under the water. The instructors are not pushy and they are very talented She is now 14 months and she swims underwater to me regularly She loves swimming and is excited to be there every time The building is also amazing and extremely clean. I recommend this place highly!
5	Aqua Safe is a must!  If you have children and want them to learn how to swim- this place is where you need to go.  My children have been attending for a while now and have almost completed the entire program.  My boys can swim and play in our pool.  They are confident swimmers and I know the teachers are to credit for this.I have had to change my schedule a few times and we always have found a swim time that is perfect for my schedule.  This facility is always clean and the staff is exceptional!
4	Great experience.  Took my 2month old for an intro class to get her started with everything. The staff was nice and our instructor Alex was amazing. Not only was she very positive and patient, she recognized that it was very loud in the pool so she took the time to repeat her instructions. I would absolutely tell my friends to bring their kids.
