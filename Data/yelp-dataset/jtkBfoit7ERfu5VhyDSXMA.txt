5	Best 'non-chippy' fish and chips. Hands down. I visited the Buckstone Bistro recently on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. I had the fish and chips and they were the best I have ever had. For reals. (This comes from someone who when they first arrived in Scotland only ate fish and chips and drank Guinness for an entire week). I received a large portion of fish but the fish presently differently - four or five rectangular chunks of deep fried fish. The fish was very tender and melted in my mouth. The batter complimented the fish well. It looks like Buckstone Bistro has recently been refurbished. The decor was modern and included pinks, purples and pewters. There were many families who were also around for lunch when I visited. They have a decent size patio outside. I'm going to make a point in coming here for lunch on a really nice day. Perhaps take the bus up, enjoy a sunday roast (or more fish and chips!) and walk down the hill back into town. I'd recommend this place if you want to 'get away' from the hustle and bustle of the city core!
