5	this is definitely one of the coolest things about my neighborhood. everyone who works here is very friendly and helpful. I use the online linkcat system all the time... they alert you via email when your requests are ready for pickup, and when things are coming due. how convenient is that? if you live in madison and don't have a library card, you're silly.
5	It's totally normal that the first thing I did after moving to Madison and getting off my flight was to stop by this library and get a library card, right? RIGHT?I didn't have any of the necessary documentation to get a library card (proof of address? I don't even know my address), but the staff here was nice enough to get me through the process anyway (while cracking the best  worst geek jokes).
3	Nice library but extremely small with not many options, I guess I will have to see if their is more variety if I request things online.
4	Since moving to the neighborhood, I've visited this library branch quite often, and it's small but cozy. Don't be put off by the shady shadesters occasionally hanging out in front...I've never had any issues. Inside, there's a large computer bank, a children's area, comfortable settle-in chairs, and it seems well organized and reasonably clean. The staff has always been very friendly and helpful. If you want a *quiet* place to work, read or use wifi, it's pretty hit or miss on that account. There doesn't seem to be much of a code of silence at libraries in general anymore, especially concerning children. Hawthorne branch is no exception. Bring earbuds, definitely. I mostly just stop in and grab my Linkcat holds, and I'm a huge fan of the Linkcat phone app! Libraries have evolved into more or less social centers, and there are good and bad things about that.
