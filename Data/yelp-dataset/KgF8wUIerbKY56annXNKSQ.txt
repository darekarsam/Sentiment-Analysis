4	Very good Lebanese food, among the best I've eaten so far. The service wasn't that great, the guy at the register was as friendly as a Taliban with American journalists. And they don't do refill for the pop drinks, which is horrible because Lebanese food make you thirsty like you haven't drink the whole day. Come on, it costs you nothing, especially the glass is the smallest I've seen in restaurants, I don't even how to call that size? Tiny? Sample?
3	Sure, Amir is Amir, but I always find myself leaving this location slightly happier than any of the others - the staff are always wonderful and super accommodating, and there's just something about the place that makes you smile.  The food is pretty average (to be expected), but for whatever reason, I'm kind of addicted to their garlic sauce. Not sure what they do differently here, but it's definitely a bangin' sauce. Oh, and they also have a great deal on daily specials. Plate, soup and a drink for something like 10 bucks. So in conclusion: if you need to go to any Amir, go to this one.
1	Will never call to order for delivery again at this restaurant. From the moment I called until I received it toke 1 hour and a 45 min!!!! Can't believe it until it really happen. Even if it was supposed to be good the food was cold and mushi.
