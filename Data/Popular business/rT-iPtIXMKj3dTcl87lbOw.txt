4	"Say, Schwan, How's the Chinese Food Around Here?"Soho Bistro is exactly what we were looking for - quick and easy predictable Chinese delivery."Quick" understates the speed of this place.  We called them minutes after placing the order to ask for utensils, and the driver had already left the restaurant (with utensils).As for "easy", you can't beat online ordering that works as well in practice as in theory.And all the flavors were exactly as they should be - potstickers/dumplings, fried rice, etc.The food was a little greasier than I would have preferred, but if you order Chinese delivery, that's to be expected.Confucius say, "Four tune cookies for Soho Bistro."  A little less oil, and Tao/Tso would be a five star general.
5	Superb service and reliably fine food from this family owned restaurant. Briskly busy at lunchtime, relaxed at night, always comfortable. A pleasure!
4	Soho Bistro is great Chinese food at a great price. I used to get take-out from here every couple of weeks when I worked uptown. I make it by there less frequently now, but I have been back a few times. It's worth the trip!My favorite lunch special is the Cantonese rice noodles without the chicken and shrimp. It's spicy, and it seems healthy. I'm sure it's cooked in a lot of oil, but it's a healthier option that a lot of the quick lunch alternatives.It can get crowded at Soho for lunch, so we usually ordered online or called in and went to pick it up. Parking can be kind of a pain in this area of uptown, so we usually took two people in the car and left one to wait while the other ran inside.Another great reason for going to Soho if you're ordering with an office is that it's located pretty close to the PIta Pit and the uptown Fuel. We'd sometimes stop at all three to get something for everybody.The prices are good, and the service is quick and friendly. I've never been let down by Soho.
3	Ordered some delivery from here while I was in Charlotte for work. The food was delivered quickly and it was actually pretty good, if not run of the mill.  I ordered the spring rolls, scallion pancakes and house special lo-mein.  The spring rolls were pretty tasty although I didnt have enough dipping sauce for all 3 of them.  The scallion pancakes were unlike any I have seen before and almost seemed on the edge of burnt but they were edible if not a little tough.The house special lo-mein was quite tasty and had lots of good crunchy veggies in it to complement the shrimp, chicken and beef but I just didn't go "WoW!" this is really good, it just seemed ok.I would order from here again if I stayed at the same hotel just outside of downtown and it was a rainy night, otherwise I might venture back downtown in search of more satisfying grub.
4	Tasty appetizers and dishes. Pungent sauces. Quick delivery. Excellent choice for Chinese food in Charlotte.
5	We decided to give this place a try the first night my wife and I were in Charlotte for a conference / vacation. The decor instantly puts you at ease. Very comfortable, not crowded at all around 7pm on a Thursday. This place has a good selection of beer and wine as well.My wife and I are vegan, and we had no problems finding something to eat. I ordered the General Tao Tofu, my wife got the curried tofu and veg. Simply put, our dinner was perfect. Perfect portion sizes (not too big, not too little), served hot, and fresh. Wait-staff was always available and helpful, water glasses were always full.A great place to eat out.
4	Great asian food, excellent service and close to uptown businesses.  The only downside is that during lunch it can be difficult to get a table with the lunch rush.  Arrive early or late in order to get in.
4	Yummy!  They have a great dish called tangerine chicken - it is so good.  Their scallion pancakes are great also.  If you plan on coming here during lunch arrive early - this place gets crowded and has a wait.  Dinner time it isnt so bad and you can usually score a table pretty quickly.  It is good chinese food and not too bad on the wallet!
4	I work across the street from this place, it serves very consistent, tasty Chinese Food. I usually call in for takeout, but the dining in experience is very enjoyable. They have very gracious hostesses/cashier's. You can't go wrong with their Chicken Fried Rice or Black Pepper Steak, those are my favorites. They have your standard Chinese Food menu and it is nothing like a Panda Queen located in a strip mall, MUCH better than that nonsense. Side Note: If you want to see efficiency at its finest, go during lunch time and watch the two cashier's work their magic, they can do so many things at once it will seriously impress you.
4	Great food, beautiful environment. Not super authentic but as far as Americanized Chinese food goes this place was super good. Also lots of veggie options and sizable quantities.
5	I've tried lots of Asian restaurants and this one is by far the best one.  Every time I have to go in the office is where I go for lunch.  Prices are very good too.
5	This place is awesome.  Coming from NY where I've been spoiled with great chinese food, SoHo Bistro is the best that I've found in charlotte.  Their prices are very reasonable too.  The servers are sweet and great.  We came in with a party of 13 and the waitress memorized everyone's orders (and drinks).  I was quite surprised when everything came back perfect.  I would definitely recommend trying this place!
5	I'm sad that I don't work and live uptown anymore because I used to treat myself to Soho Bistro at least once a week..ok sometimes twice. The staff was always friendly to me and due to the lunch time being extremely busy I would always order my food via uptown2go.com. My favorites were the shrimp fried rice (yummy) and pepper steak (double yummy!). The lunch portions were always hearty and I'd usually have some left over for dinner.  The next time I'm uptown I'll make sure to stop in and remind my taste buds of what they've been missing.
3	This is probably the best Chinese food in uptown, though I think that's an indictment of the overall quality of Chinese food in Charlotte.  The food here is average to good, and is always packed during the work week at lunchtime.  Service is fast, but otherwise forgettable.  Prices are very good as well, you can get out of there if you sit down for about 10-12 bucks with tip.  I normally get the Tangerine chicken, or the beef and broccoli.  The chicken sometimes comes with too much sauce, but it has the right level of spiciness.  Overall, a good place to sate your craving for Chinese, but if you are looking for a great meal, look elsewhere.
3	Soho is not on my list of places to go for lunch uptown, but occasionally group lunches leave you no choice, so I end up having to come here once or twice a year and my view of them still has not changed........average.
3	Very impressed with certain items like the ' Sauteed Bean Sprouts w/ Ginger'. Could not believe that Bean sprouts could taste that good. Also liked the Buddha Roll and the Asian Summer Roll. Brocolli With Garlic Sauce was not that great and neither was Thai Curry Tofu. Veggie Lo mein was good too. My ratings Guide* Stay Away** Eat if you are hungry and can't find anything*** It's alright, you'll get your money's worth**** Must try***** Beyond this world. Don't miss it.
4	Some of the best tofu I've found in Charlotte. Absolutely amazing! The service is pretty good too, I'm definitely a fan of it.
4	Old reliable. This place knows how to fit my lunch needs in a major way. I try to get here atleast once a week. They have some of the best chinese food in town.The twins that work the front are awesome and transition everybody in and out as efficiently as possible. They have yet to mess up my order, despite being extremely overcrowded.The food is tremendous and fresh. Their edimames are to die for. The steam them and salt them to perfection. If you are uptown and are craving chinese food, go to soho bistro.7 on the legitimate big dog scale here. This place is as reliable as you can ever imagine. That's what's good.
5	I have never had better Chinese food. The food was fresh and no hint of MSG. The location is fantastic and centrally located to everything. It is small and intimate and they even offer vegetarian meals. I had the Lo Mein and it was so delicious. They offer drinks as well including beer and wine. The staff there is so friendly and the wait for our meal was minimal. The food was so delicious I've gone back again and again introducing it to friends and they love it as much as I do.
3	Not bad for a quick, relatively authentic Chinese lunch in a nicer setting. I had the Beef Chow Foon, which was pretty good, just a tad salty. Very reasonable price though and service was extremely friendly and fast. They validate parking in the Hearst Tower.
4	I stumbled upon this place one day. The food was really great and fast. The setting was cozy. everything from the lighting to waitstaff made for an enjoyable meal. In the busy Uptown area, it's nice to know I can grab a quick lunch that I know will be great. Everything on the lunch menu is in the $5-$7 dollar range so, it won't hurt the wallet either! The location right next to Time Warner Cable makes Soho a great stop after a Bobcats game!
4	I'd say this is one of the more consistent lunch places in uptown. I usually get the dynasty noodles with a side hot sauce and the food always comes out pretty quickly. I guess they've got to keep the food moving since there's always a crowd during lunch hour. I wouldn't say that it's the best Chinese food I've ever had, but it definitely is one of the best Chinese places in Charlotte.
4	I love this place! I started going here when I was doing my internship with the Bobcats. It's a 5 minute walk from the arena. Everyone is so friendly and the food is great not to mention cheap! I never spent more than $8 on lunch. The chicken and broccoli is by far my favorite thing on the menu. If you're going for lunch, I would plan on taking a late one cause they are always packed during the week. Between 1:30 and 2:00 is when it dies down and is a little bit quieter.
4	First for the price and portions downtown I don't know if you'll find better value. All the ingredients are fresh. Service was fantastic. The dumpling sauce is tasty! Would reccomend.
4	I discovered Soho Bistro a few years ago by complete accident.  I typically only go a couple times a year, but it never disappoints!Last night I popped in for dinner by myself.  The wait staff was very prompt and friendly.  I opted to order two things: scallion pancakes and their pineapple/chicken rice dish.  Most Chinses places here in NC/SC do not offer scallion pancakes (which is a travesty because I LOVE THEM).  When I told the server how much I missed them since moving here from NY, she laughed and said the owners were from NY.  No wonder they are on the menu!  They came out fresh and hot, and while they were prepared differently than expected (there wasn't as much scallion flavor as I hoped for) they were still delicious and easily enough for two people. They are about $4 on the menu.But it's the pineapple chicken dish I want to talk about.  When the server came out with my food, I found myself facing a HUGE plate of steaming, aromatic food.  Easily enough food for three people, I found myself wolfing down perfectly cooked rice, tasty bits of chicken, and huge pieces of pineapple.  Had I been going home after the meal I'd have had more than enough to cover BOTH lunch and dinner today.  Since I wasn't going straight home, I ate way more than I should have - but with a smile on my face the entire time.  The dish was only about $9 on the menu.  The restaurant has a pleasing, simple decor.  They do not serve liquor - only beer and wine.  The prices are outstanding considering the portions you get.As I said, I don't get to go there often, but when I get the chance, I always enjoy it.
4	Typical, quick in and quick out style Chinese food joint.  I've only had the lunch here and each time I've been pleased.  Portion sizes are a bit large and they keep the drinks coming.  Avoid getting a soda here, they tend to be flat.  I think they just buy 2 liters probably.  Service is always quick, almost too quick, they love to push the check to the table ASAP.  I understand that though because this place does get pretty packed during lunch.
4	I was teetering between 3 stars and 4 stars, but went with 4 stars!Came here during lunch hour with co-workers to grab a birthday lunch - nothing super-fancy, but something solid.  I appreciated it since no one likes to go eat lunch wif me *sniffle* (They all pack their own lunches or don't eat - "Lunch is for wimps!).  But yesterday, I had lunch buddies, yay!We all had the lunch special which came out in a timely manner and the place was poppin'.  It was a birthday, so I asked the manager/server if they had anything special for birfdays, she said No.  I said, okay, makes sense - who comes here for birthday lunch.  I ordered a chocolake cake though anyways.  Lunch was solid, maybe a little on the sweet side.  I had the chicken/shrimp/mixed vegetables and the sauce was a little sweet.  General Tsao's chicken (?) was also a little sweet my buddy said.  Oh yeah, AVOID the innocuous looking mustard bottle.  It's not your average mustard sauce that comes in the little packets from Chinese restaurants.  This one was sinus-clearing, eyes-water, fire-breathing. Yeah, it was so hot.At the end, they brought out the cake.  Low and behold, it had a witto candle on top which the manager/owner had to keep from blowing out with the wine glass (damn, asian people are smart!).  It was a nice way to end the impromptu birfday lunch.Will I go here again?  Prob after I've dated a GF for a few months. It's a dimly lit, quaint comfortable Chinese food spot - like a solid 8th dinner date or a 4-year-been-with-the-ball-&-chain(wifey)-and-we-need-to-pretend-we-still-have-romantic-dates place. dmo out.
2	I had carryout. Very quick but kinda confusing to find the place. I was expecting good things because the reviews seem to rave about this place but honestly I was really disappointed. The food is mediocre, I have had WAY better and I can't say that anything I had was really that great. I'll be looking for a different chinese place to eat at.
2	I have had Chinese food in a bunch of different cities, including NYC and San Francisco to name a few. So far I have not found a good Chinese food place here in Charlotte. If you go to Soho for pick up don't follow their address to the T because it is actually on the other side of the building next to Fuel Pizza. Call ahead when you are about 5 minutes away and they will come outside to deliver your food. As far as the food goes, the dumplings are a little too doughy but the sauce is quite good. I would not recommend the spring rolls they are kinda bland. I am not going to X this place out just yet I may give it another shot. Still looking for a good Chinese Food place here in Charlotte wish me luck!
4	Came here for the first time on 1/20/2012 with friends. Atmosphere isn't overly fancy like some places downtown, but definitely way nicer than your average take out Chinese.Ordered sesame tofu since it's my old faithful at any Chinese restaurant... and boy was I impressed!  Definitely the best sesame tofu I've had since "House" on Independence closed down. Tofu was a perfect amount of chewy and crispy and not overly sauced. Steamed white rice was delish and spring rolls were definitely superior than any other I've had, but I couldn't put my finger on exactly why.Vegetarian friendly.The only down to this restaurant, like any business in downtown Charlotte, is that you have to park in a deck or meter on the street (if you can find one). I know for sure that Hearst Tower parking tickets can be validated by Soho so that parking is free!
5	Me, the fine newcomer Elizabeth A. and Heather X., went here on a rainy Friday at 330pm and I left wanting to come back the next day.They still were serving lunch at 330 which ROCKED for moi, who is a chronic late luncher since my job lets me sleep in a bit :) Parking in the Hearst Tower lot is the best idea since they validate your ticket, so be sure to bring it in with you!A smaller place than I expected, there's a great, mellow vibe here. The lights that hang over the tables are beautifully warm with medium colored wood and soft white bulbs inside frosted glass. While empty when we arrived, I can definitely see this place being crowded at lunchtime between 1130-130 so heads up on that! Calling it in seemed to be a pretty good option and one that was utilized alot while we were there!Starting off with crab ragoons and asian fresh rolls, we shared and IMO the crab ragoons really shone about and beyond. The fresh rolls were good, but I wasn't a fan of the sauce they came with (reminded me of an Indian fig sort of thick sauce) and the duck sauce wasn't meshing well with it either.I ordered the General Tofu and while I feel like I'm piggy-backing onto Elizabeth's review, it was true that the tofu was PERFECT. I mean, HOLYYYY MOTHER THIS IS PERFECT. From the fry (not overly but not soggy under), to the sauce (I asked for it extra spicy, and they delivered!), to the picking of your own veggie (I choose brocoli which came out not mushy, not stiff but the almost unreachable middle ground) and the delish spring roll (something is added to this that is not in most - no clue what but it makes it hearty but still light).The service was attentive, kind and accommodating, the space was intimate yet casual and the food was stellar. That's a WIN WIN WIN in my book! Enjoy!
3	I just moved here to Charlotte from NorCal and one of my favorite foods to eat back in Cali was Chinese food.  So I was excited to find this place.  I have to say it does NOT compare to Chinese back at home. I ordered potstickers (called dumplings here) and the skin was too thick and there was barely any meat inside.  Not a good first impression. I wanted chow mein so I ordered the House Lo Mein...too salty.  They put too much oyster sauce or soy sauce.  This also made the noodles squirmy.  I ordered broccoli on the side and at least that was good.  I hope there are better Chinese food spots out here.  Since this place was in Uptown I hope this isnt the best they got...3 stars because their service was good
5	I've been a regular visitor of Soho practically since they opened, which is probably close to 10 years ago at this point.In all of my travels around the world, Soho's chinese food is just about at the top of the charts.  They use fresh ingredients, have a fantastic staff, and will alter any dish to your likings.  They have an extensive vegetarian menu, and also will make the standard meat dishes vegetarian.Ownership and staff is top-notch. It's not your run of the mill chinese place with generic sauces and formerly-frozen veggies.  Everything is fresh and wonderful.
5	This is some of the best Chinese delivery I've ever had, and I've gotten delivery in Soho, NYC before! A bit pricey for delivery, but after you have a bite you'll know why. Scrumptious! Quick delivery too!
3	I was staying at the Holiday Inn for a business trip and this place was within walking distance.  For convenience, I actually had food from Soho twice during my short trip.  They were A-OK... is the best I can describe it.  Is the food hot and fresh, yes.  Is it very yummy... eh, not really.  I've tried a duck dish, a kung pao chicken dish, wonton soup, fried rice.  Nothing was bad, but nothing wow'd me either.  So, given the location and price point, I'd go back again.
4	Visited Charlotte during my vacation and must say this is one of the nicest more friendly people I met during my road trip and the service at this restaurant was par to none.  My server was very polite and helpful.  My comment to her after passing the menu right back to her was "Suprise Me".   What she started me off with perfectly stuffed fresh spring rolls.  I have had rolls from many asian restaurants, but non had this much shrimp inside.  Being use to other places that slice the shrimp and put less than half at times in the roll.  These were filled very nice and had great flavor.   She kept my tea glass full, which might I add I did not use any sugar.  It was fresh and tasted right.   My entree came out and it was pepper beef I think.  Crispy beef.  Great flavor, done so well with great seasoning and the rice was tender and nice.   I thoroughly enjoyed this visit to this business.  Stop in and enjoy.
3	In a lunch rush? You can count on Soho to delivery hot, plentiful edibles in the time it takes some people to get through a long drive-through line. Husband and I met up for lunch just a couple minutes after noon. By 12:30, we'd dined and had the check in hand.Service is prompt, and polite/friendly in a rushed kind of way - they know how to get people in and out, on the double. We were checked on by three different servers, plus one more at the end of our meal after we'd finished eating and the plates had been cleared, who wanted to make sure someone had taken our order!Husband likes the sweet & sour chicken, which always looks well prepared, though I've never tried it since it's not a favorite of mine. This time I went for the Thai Curry Shrimp ($6.99). The curry sauce tasted more in line with flavors I'd expect from Indian food - sweet and heavy on the turmeric - and like it maaay have had its origins in a bottle or package of some kind, but it was still good, and pleasantly, mildly spiced. There were large chunks of vegetables in the mix, and they are not stingy with the shrimp. The brown rice was good and chewy, and spring rolls served piping hot and crispy, straight from the fryer.It may not be the most authentic international cuisine you'll ever eat, but when pressed for time and watching your budget, Soho is as great as anything you could want.One last thing - be care with the address! While the city may put it on Tryon, the entrance is actually on College. I spent several minutes walking up and down Tryon between 5th and 6th, looking to no avail before finally calling Husband, who directed me down to the next street.
4	***BE WARNED! THE ADDRESS IS TRYON STREET BUT IT'S ACTUALLY ON COLLEGE STREET. YOU CANNOT GET HERE FROM TRYON***Four years after leaving south Charlotte I finally find a Chinese place with reasonable enough prices and good enough food to rival Taipei South!Everything I've tried at this place is fantastic! Several months back I brought my mom in here for a lunch break while showing her around town and now every time she comes to visit and lunch or dinner time rolls around she wants to go to Soho. It's only the large number of other great restaurants in the area that keeps us from eating here every time. The egg rolls are perfectly crispy without being greasy. If you order something with shrimp you actually get a decent amount of shrimp. This alone is enough to make Soho stand out among all the other Chinese restaurants in the same price range and even some that are considerably more expensive.
4	mmmmm....yummy food! Did not except such good food to be honest.
3	If you haven't had the eggplant dish, you're missing out. I was craving some non-green veggies and it totally hit the spot. I wiped the whole plate clean. One disappointing thing to note is that the eggrolls are horrible. :( How can you mess that up at a chinese restaurant? The filling seemed to be made out of leftover scraps (tiny bitty pieces of ground meat (or not meat? i couldn't even tell), and barely any cabbage). It did not taste good at all no matter how much duck sauce I poured to cover the weird taste.
2	It is my opinion there are no good Chinese restaurants Uptown, and Soho Bistro continues to prove me right.I have been here two or three times now, and I tend to order the more "authentic," or less popular items such as the beef noodle soup, Japanese ramen, and they have both let me down.Also, whenever I come here for dinner I am literally the only customer in the dining area. I think that Soho Bistro must really be only a lunch place.
4	Awesome! Went for dinner last night with a group of four.  Two chicken dishes, two shrimp dishes: Sesame shrimp, Szechuan shrimp, Honey Lemon Chicken, Tangerine Chicken.  The flavors were amazing, but I hate eating dark meat.  I'm deducting a star for that.  We had a great little server and we couldn't have been happier!!! We will be back for sure.
4	Probably one of the best affordable ethnic places to eat in uptown, I think this kicks Basil's butt any day. I usually come here for a dinner date, it is usually quiet.Oh and did I mention the best fried egg rolls I've had. Ever. Fresh crispy crunch, worth having at least once a month if diet is not a question for you.
5	When I use to work in Uptown Charlotte, I would typically eat here almost once a week.  It is rather small restaurant, and always has a line around Noon, but it's worth checking out.  Typically, I order the Tangerine Chicken with white rice and egg roll (substitute from spring roll); the wait time varies 5-10 minutes from order to table.  The portions are good compared to price and I never had any issues.  There is outside seating available, but its on the street and it can be pretty loud.  Overall, worth checking out if in the area and have a hankering for good Chinese food; if you go during the Lunch rush, try to go early or late.
4	First pointer: Although the address says N. Tryon, the entrance to this place is on College St (back side of Hearst Tower) so you can decide where to park. We parked at Church and 5th thinking it was just around the corner but then had to walk two blocks which wasn't a pleasant walk on our way back from dinner when it got chilly and rainy.Ambiance: Intimate. Soft lighting and pleasant music. We went at a time when the restaurant wasn't crowded. Only 4 tables were occupied, but I believe this place must be packed for lunch.Service was courteous and our food arrived in reasonable time. Our server kept our glasses full.We ordered the Summer Roll and Hot and Sour Soup. The Summer Rolls were as good as any others (they all taste the same) but the veggies were fresh. The Hot and Sour soup was good (we split it). For the entree we had the Mongolian chicken, which was mind blowing. It had just the right amount of spice, hot enough to open up my blocked sinuses, but not overly spicy. The flavors perfectly melded. The portions were large enough. Me and my boyfriend left the place with full tummies and some leftover Mongolian chicken.
5	I'm visiting Charlotte on a business trip from STL and have been craving some Chinese like crazy! This place is right across the street from my hotel but after a long day I just didn't feel like evening my room. I used their online ordering system which is super-easy and user friendly. Food arrived not even 20 minutes later on a Friday night. The beef with broccoli was in a plastic fridge/microwave-friendly to-go box and the crab wontons are delicious; not overly cream-cheesy. I'm here for two more weeks and will definitely be ordering again. Reasonably priced as well. ONLY bummer: they don't have Moo-Shoo Pork :-(
2	We had lunch here during a rather unbusy Saturday.  Most places in this area seem to only serve dinner on Saturday so this was one the few seemingly vegan-friendly Saturday lunch spots.Sad to say, my entree was a little bland. It was a tofu, vegetables, and wide rice noodles entree.  It surely looked spectacular with the varied vibrant colors and large portion size, but it failed to delivery on tastiness!  No bother, I drowned the sucker in chile sauce and soy sauce until it was more edible. The tofu spring rolls appetizer suffered from a similar tastelessness.  At least service was prompt and everything was salvageable with a little doctoring up.  I suspect that the omnivore dishes may be more palatable as my companion didn't seem bothered, but she is polite gal, so who knows!  The large portion size did permit me to chow down again later, which is always appreciated when I am about to possibly spend all night throwing back drinks, with little or no vegan options immediately available.  I don't know, I'm willing to gander Soho Bistro is probably not too bad for most diners, but it just didn't do it for me!
3	Went here for lunch and we were the only ones in there. We got great service because of it, but I wondered why no one else was in there? I got the eggplant special, as I always order eggplant in a Chinese restaurant.   The food was pretty good although the portions were small compared to some. I will likely return sometime.
3	So, we decided to enjoy Soho today, during the lunch rush, ugh! The place was very crowded, but as others mentioned the service is definitely quick, a little too quick.  We all chose different entrees, which included rice, white, brown, or fried, and a spring roll. I ordered the Chicken & Shrimp with vegetables, and fried rice. The spring roll was a little disappointing, no real filler.  As for the veggies and chicken, delish, but skimpy on the baby shrimp, will pass on that option next time. And, unfortunately I was given brown rice, or maybe it was fried, if so, not great, and on the colder side. Overall, it is a quick lunch, with good prices, but nothing stood out in my mind.
5	WOW! Very good food!!!!! The wait staff was very friendly and quick!  I always love the sharing family style of chinese restaurants!  You must go here!!! AWESOME PLACE!!!!!  And the person who suggested the donuts!!! THANK YOU!!!! THEY WERE AMAZING!!!!
5	I give this place 5 stars for the extraordinary service. They make repeat customers feel like cherished friends. The sesame tofu is the best I've had in Charlotte. Breaded and super crispy... Yum!
2	Food is decent, but service is no good. I was here before a couple of years and did not want to go back because of the service. Unfortunately, went in for lunch today and had a similar experience with service. I know I won't make the same mistake again!
4	Varied menu from what you usually encounter in an Asian diner. Food was good and portions were the right size.
5	The service was good and the food came out very soon after we ordered. The menu is extensive and has many different options of Thai and Chinese dishes. The menu offers anything from soup to noodle dishes to stir fry. I ordered their spicy soup with shrimp and it was very good and actually spicy and had a lot of veggies in it. The restaurant itself is but small but went during the week and it wasn't crowded at all! I would definitely eat here again and it's very close to the arena!
5	This restaurant has been open for over 10 years,  and the food and staff has been great and very consistent.  My favorite is the Tangerine Chicken,  and my wife loves their Honey Walnut Shrimp. I've never been disappointed with my food.
3	The atmosphere was nice in the restaurant.  We had a very tentative waiter all the way until it was time for the check.  He never came back to the table after dropping off the check.  I wonder if he was telling us that the food was free because it was just OK?  Well, when the gal at the front saw me looking around she finally came by to get the check.  Then we ordered a to go lunch which took forever.  Come to find out it was already sitting at the front waiting.  I caught the same girls eyes which is when she finally motioned that the food was there already.  Really? You couldn't come over to the table to tell us?  I can see why she wouldn't hand the to go food to us before we paid but at least tell me it is there already.The food was just OK.  Considering I live in California where we have a lot of true Asian restaurants.  I ordered the noodle soup with egg noodles and the noodles they used were the  fat noodles rather than the thin egg noodles which is what you would normally see in a true Asian restaurant.  It had a good flavor but fat noodles do not do anything for me.  Then I thought, let me try their house fried rice. I normally judge the Chinese Restaurant by the presentation of their house fried rice.  Have you ever ordered a regular fried rice from a Chinese restaurant?  Normally the regular fried rice they just in a frying pan add some soy sauce and that's it.  This was they also added some meat, shrimp and bean sprouts.  I wonder if I should give them my recipe for Yang Chow Fried Rice?  The house fried rice flavor was just OK and I would not call it anything better.  Just OK food is exactly what it is.  There you have it.
4	Neat little Chinese bistro in the heart of Uptown. Service was excellent and the atmosphere is intimate. I'm guessing this is a Hong Kong style place? A fair mix of Cantonese and Mandarin dishes, including some Curry Noodles, Cantonese Rice Noodles, Sha Cha Chicken and a ton of seafood dishes including (!) Mahi Mahi.I went with the Cantonese Noodles and they were around a B/B+. I think they could have made the noodles much spicier and gone heavier on the seasonings. My friend ordered a General Tso's Tofu, which was delightfully crispy and sweet on the outside but perfectly soft on the inside. He also ordered the Teriyaki Chicken appetizer which was served satay-style on a skewer. This again was good, though fairly dumbed-down for what (I assume) the owners think is a spice-averse audience in Charlotte.So, in spite of the good review, my message to SoHo is this: DON'T BE AFRAID TO MAKE THE FOOD MORE AUTHENTIC. BE BRAVE! Look, you might be thinking most Americans want bland Chinese food - but, the times, they are a changin'. There are a ton of culturally educated, adventurous foodies out there and they are DYING for legit Chinese cuisine. Go forth and give us a place to call home!
3	Pretty good overall. I ordered a spring roll and an egg roll - both were a little bland (and greasy) for my taste. The steamed veggies were perfectly cooked - a combination of broccoli , zucchini, carrots, sugar peas, and napa cabbage. (Heavy on the broccoli.) The white rice that came with my steamed veggies was also perfectly cooked. I also tried the teriyaki chicken skewers - the flavor was excellent, as was the quality of the chicken (lean breast meat) - unfortunately it was a tad dry. I enjoyed it by adding an excess of dipping sauce :) I would try this restaurant again if I'm in the mood for Chinese food.  *On a side note, be aware that your delivery may not arrive when you request - my delivery came 25 min PRIOR to my requested time... just as I was getting out of the shower- yikes :)
5	This is a great spot. I've been going here for years. The staff there has treated me like family since day one. Every time I go in they call me by name and make me feel special. The food is fantastic too! Go check out this spot.
5	This may be the best Asian food in Charlotte.  It is not exotic or pretentious, but it is really good food in a nice atmosphere.  The vegetable dishes are extraordinarily well done, and they will make or adjust things to order if you ask.  My vegetarian friends like this better than any other restaurant uptown.  Also, the prices are very reasonable for a business lunch uptown, and it is a good place to talk.  Service has been fast each of the five or six times I have been.  All round, a great place.
2	This is located in the heart of downtown. Food is average and service is not bad. Will be busy during peak lunch hours from 11:30 to 1:30 PM. But take out is very fast. I have been going here for past 7 years and one thing that sucks big time is the two Cantonese women who manages this place.  They have no idea what is a good service in a restaurant means. They are rude. Literally rude. Half the time you don't understand what they speak in English. No in this restaurant are polite. They serve food as if they are serving people in homeless place. And they never treat you as patrons by the way. Am I eating and dining there ? "No". I am try taking out? "Yes"Location : 4/5Ambience: 3/5Service: 2/5Food: 2.5/5
5	Excellent food and excellent service. Wait staff is always very attentive, constantly refilling drinks, etc. Lunch rush does make for a bit of a wait, but there are only so many tables. Highly recommended.
2	We stayed at the Holiday Inn Center City for a trip and happened to visit Soho Bistro for dinner on a rainy evening. The restaurant is clean, well laid out and appealing. The staff was exceptionally friendly and our waiter was a young man who was very eager to please. Unfortunately, the food was sub-par. The egg roll and scallion pancakes were hot and tasty, but our entrees were disappointing. I ordered honey walnut chicken and was served honey walnut shrimp. This wouldn't have been a big deal, but I have a shellfish allergy. They corrected the error, but when the chicken was served, it was burned and it was clear that the veggie garnishes were transferred from one plate to the other. My dinner companion ordered noodles which he described as tasting like watered down spaghetti with weak curry sauce. I can't stress how nice the people were, but the food portion could use a visit from Kitchen Nightmares.
4	I just called  our delivery order in after ringing MANY local establishments that do not deliver. Their customer service is friendly and quick
2	I've been going to this place for a few years now, and every time I go it loses another star and another chance. It used to be the best place to get Chinese food but recently it has gotten really gross. Today was the last straw. I got the Steamed Chicken Dumplings and a order of Edamame to go. The dumplings had no taste other than salt,  the dough was so think and chewy I didn't eat my last two. The worst part were the soy beans. Half of them rotten, no salt, no seasonings, just plan nasty and I tossed about half of the order. Come on guys I know you can do better!
5	I've dined and ordered take-outs from here about 20 or so times. I consider one of the perks of working in Hearst tower as having Soho just downstairs :)Super quick service + consistently good food = good experience. My favorite dish at this place is black pepper beef. Tip - you can order your food without MSG, if you'd like.
3	Ordered some take out on Sunday night. I would actually give this place 3.5 stars if it allowed me to.I ordered the following:Wonton noodle soup 3/5Chicken lo Mein 4/5Egg rolls 4/5 good but smallChicken with broccoli 2/5 -- this is usually my go to and I was pretty disappointed. Chicken and broccoli were cooked fine, but the sauce was very "pinkish/orangish" vs the standard darker brown sauce in accustomed to. It just didn't taste right. Idk how else to explain it.I will give them another shot next time I want Chinese take out. It will ultimately let me know if I will continue to order from there, or if I need to start looking for a new takeout spot.
4	I last reviewed Soho Bistro in mid-2011, and last night my young daughter and I popped in there for dinner before a show.  I thought I'd provide an updated review!The place is still awesome.  The atmosphere is still peaceful and quiet, and the wait staff efficient and polite.We ordered four items off the menu: scallion pancakes, crab wontons, tangerine chicken and sesame shrimp.  The scallion pancakes were just as good as they ever were.  The crab wontons were a bit disappointing - we were expecting something closer to crab Rangoon (based on the description) but these are more grainy than creamy.  The filling almost looked like cous cous or quinoa.  Despite this, we ate all but two of them, so they were still good.My tangerine chicken was OUTSTANDING.  From first bite to last, it was delicious and is my new favorite thing.  My daughter's sesame shrimp was also delicious (she let me have a bite) although she thought it was a little too sweet.Staff was quick to refill drinks throughout the meal, and our total bill for dinner was $38 - a relative bargain considering we had two appetizers, two entrees and multiple refills on my daughter's soda.  I continue to recommend this place for good Chinese food at a great price.  Can't wait until my next event uptown so that I can dine here again!
